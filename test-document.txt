AIME's Indigenous Wisdom Framework

This document explores how Indigenous systems thinking can transform modern organizations through mentoring relationships and community-centered approaches. 

The hoodie economics model demonstrates that when we prioritize relationships over profit, we create sustainable value for seven generations. This approach recognizes that imagination is the primary currency in knowledge economies.

Through the Joy Corps methodology, organizations can embed Indigenous wisdom into their operations, creating networks of transformation that honor reciprocity and connection. The IMAGI-NATION vision represents a fundamental shift toward systems that support both individual growth and collective flourishing.

Key principles include:
- Seven-generation thinking for long-term impact
- Mentoring as the foundation for change
- Community wisdom guiding decision-making
- Imagination as a tool for transformation
- Relationships as the basis for all meaningful work

This framework has been successfully implemented across multiple sectors, demonstrating that Indigenous knowledge systems offer practical solutions for contemporary challenges.
