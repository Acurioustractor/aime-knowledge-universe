They told me I was no good at waiting tables. I was devastated because I didn't know how to do anything else. It took me some time but I finally decided to go get some qualifications in something else and so I enrolled in University.\n\nSometimes you need to hit a brick wall to find a door or window of opportunity.\n\nJo McCoy\nAustralia\nAIME Failure Time Submission\nSubmit yours today!

It can cooking toast without burning it, for me success is to be an artist.\"\n\nTaika Waititi\nAcademy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Grammy Award winner and\nNew Zealand filmmaker\n\nTaken from AIME TV (https://vimeo.com/311985724) ,  (https://vimeo.com/248413120) first released in 2017\n\nYep...we realise that Taika was in here not too long ago. Failure on our part to communicate well.\n\nLearning - set up a better flow of history for editors!\n\nHard to get sick of this legend though...\n\n\n** Failure Time Stories\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLaurean Ntaate\nAIME, Communications All-Rounder\nUganda\n\n\"If you don't fail you're not even trying\"\nDenzel Washington\n\nYesterday being Father's Day had me reflect on the days I spent with my late father for most of my childhood. Where I'm from, society suggests as a people we shouldn't fail at anything, we ought to be perfect and this is what we are taught right from home to school.\n\nDad to me was always seen as a superhero, the one guy loved by everyone, a guy that was all-knowing, a gentleman, articulate, and basically zero flaws. As a household, the kids weren't allowed to fail in class because if you did and returned home with a weeping report card you'd get a flogging, if you broke a plate or cup your behind would be in for it, and returned from school with dirty uniform or torn shoes from playing soccer had the sound of canes rumble on your behind. So, we basically lived in fear of doing anything wrong. Was this right? By then I believed it was but as I grew older and became independent I learned that it was wrong. When dad retired from being an insurer he stayed home most of the time and noticed we were very afraid of him because any thought of making an error at anything would send a shiver down your spine. He once said, \"You should have met your grandfather, he was a terrorist! The man always commanded respect\". So, is this why you're the way you are? I thought\nto myself (in silence, of course).\n\nHis retirement later had him start a generator sales business and at one time he failed to make a sale for nearly a year, I had never seen him so down and yet humble. When he came to visit my brother and me in boarding school I always asked for any luck with that generator that was seated in the compound and his look was just enough to answer my question. At this point when I failed at maths or chemistry instead of yelling or frowning he always joked and told stories of how he had a lazy classmate in his time that sucked at almost every subject and were now bank managers, proprietors, and so on. After that visitation, I always felt a spark of hope at getting better in class, and it for sure had an impact.\nPapa, baby me & Godfather\n\nFast forward to when I'm out in the job markets the narrative completely changed as I sought entrepreneurial advice from him. He advised me to always keep trying and never to give up on what I believed in, this seemed odd coming from a man known to be so tough and spot on.\n\nThe first time I was leaving Uganda for Kenya for a business tour with a friend I phoned to tell him I was off on a long trip and he was so excited for me. Having flopped a lot at many things I honestly hadn't felt that much gratitude coming from him. I guess he saw a young man dressed in bravery ready to face the world, I was ready. From that point on I tried to do the best I could even if it never worked out because I learned that it's better to try and fail than never to try at all.\n\nThe last ten years have taught me to always keep going no matter the weather. I look back at failing to harvest a ploughed garden for 6 years straight and later breaking through, organizing a ComicCon alien to a country for 5 years with countless failures. My determination still shines bright as day and I know my dad would be proud of how different I look at failure today.\n\nWhen I joined AIME a few weeks ago I was oriented into an awesome work system and environment and with it, I learned of Ricardo Semler a man many have called mad but his ideologies suggest that we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know in this case being a failure. Imagine if failure were widely taught in school, wouldn't it be amazing?\n\nThe fear of failure yields to worry which is still the greatest threat to success today.\n\n''To fail is to learn so continue to practice to make progress'' says the little voice in my head.\nTell us your story (https://failuretime.softr.app/) , in whatever capacity!\nAdd your name, a time you failed, and what you learned.

What's this all about?\n\nPlatypus\n\n(head popping up out of the water)\n\nAh, the IMAGI-NATION Presidents VISA! It’s an amazing opportunity for young people, like you, aged 12 to 30, who’ve been pushed outside of the margins, either by history or by today’s challenges. It’s about stepping up to take on a leadership role that’s deeply connected to nature.\n\nSuz\n\n(looking at her hand as she moves it in and out of the shade)\n\nMargins? Like people who’ve been left out or excluded?\n\nPlatypus\n\nExactly. Think of it this way—historically, those who were left outside the castle, so to speak, were marginalised by societal design. But today, even if you’re born “inside the castle,”, climate change affects everyone. This VISA is about acknowledging that and empowering all young people to make a real difference.\n\nSuz\n\nSo what’s the role of an IMAGI-NATION President?\n\nPlatypus\n\n(swimming closer to the bank and popping her head out again)\n\nAs an IMAGI-NATION President, you’re tasked with re-establishing custodial economies. These are economies that focus on the well-being of nature and its resources. This is about shifting from our current, often exploitative systems to ones where humans act as custodians—guides who live in harmony with nature and maintain the balance of life.\n\nSuz\n\nThat sounds… profound. But what does being a custodian actually mean?\n\nPlatypus\n\nBeing a custodian means recognising that nature is intelligent, and we have to live and learn from our natural environment. We aren’t separate from nature; we’re a part of it. As custodians, our role is to ensure that knowledge and resources are shared, not kept. We were born from nature, we live and die with nature and return to it, so everything we do should respect this relationship.\n\nSuz\n\nWow, that’s powerful. But how do we actually do this? I mean, the economy doesn’t really work that way now.\n\nPlatypus\n\nTrue, our current economic models aren’t built on custodial relations, but that’s where you come in. As IMAGI-NATION Presidents, our mission is to integrate custodial economies with the systems we have. Imagine 1,000 young people worldwide, each one focusing on a key species, waterway, or ecosystem in their region, creating models that prioritise nature.\n\nSuz\n\nOkay, so the first step is connecting with nature. But what comes next?\n\nPlatypus\n\nOnce we’ve reconnected people with nature and spent time understanding it, the next challenge is moving money to support these nature-centred economies. It’s about shifting funds from systems that extract from nature to those that nurture it. No amount of protest alone can do this—we need actionable plans to make a nature-centred economy a reality.\n\nSuz\n\nThis is starting to sound like a movement. What happens if we succeed?\n\nPlatypus\n\nWhen we succeed, we’ll see  incredible outcomes. We’ll move attention and money back to nature, create healthier networks, and secure the health of the land and its bioregions. We’ll write the book—literally—on how future generations can establish custodial economies. It’s about moving from protest to impactful action, guided by new rules for learning and connection.\n\nSuz\n\nAnd how do we know we’re making progress?\n\nPlatypus\n\nThe accreditation journey for an IMAGI-NATION President tracks four key things: how many people you reconnect with nature, the time spent in nature, the amount of money moved back to nature, and how openly you share your designs and processes for network health.\n\nSuz\n\nThat sounds intense but meaningful. So, how do we even begin to move $800 billion back to nature?\n\nPlatypus\n\nThat’s the challenge we’re all taking on. But instead of relying on the same old solutions from traditional institutions, we’re putting the power in the hands of young people—those who will inherit this earth. We’ll explore everything from ancient knowledge to modern technology, translating wisdom into new frameworks that prioritise nature.\n\nSuz\n\nI’m in. This sounds like the kind of challenge that could really change the world.\n\nPlatypus\n\nIt absolutely can. Here is the application link for you to sign up today.\n\nAnd that’s how it’s done, everyone! A world of opportunities is opening up for marginalised youth to place nature at the heart of our economies and to bring often-overlooked intelligence to the forefront of design.\n\nRemember:\n* Action visa applications close: 31 AUG\n* Action visa onboarding: SEPT\n* Action visas commence: 1 OCT\n* 1st Action Visa Club of Unlikely Connections: 4 OCT\n\nDon’t wait for someone else to take the lead—you can make a difference right now!\n\nUntil we connect again, keep envisioning, keep linking up, and keep making ripples—one hoodie at a time!\n\nIn kindness,\nThe Visa Office Team\n\nP.S.

And so often people just take one aspect and yes they've solved it, they can do this but then again and again, and again, solving that problem leads to another problem. So you need to have the imagination to think, well if I solve this, what might that do to the ecosystem, to create another problem? And then how would I solve that?\"\n\nThe Jane Goodall interview (https://vimeo.com/509990615) with Jack and Hope was streamed as part of the IMAGI-NATION {University} O'Week 2022\nhttps://youtu.be/c0b17FrFdrE\nLast week we launched O'Week for IMAGI-NATION {University}.\n\nThree beautiful days where 191 Global Ambassadors of Equality from over 30 countries came together to meet, talk and inspire the change that we all want to see.\n\nThis is just the beginning of a foundational journey for our Ambassadors as they dig into the {University} knowledge and build out their change projects for 2022.\n\nThis year we have decided to connect with our Ambassadors in Signal groups\n\nOur Ambassadors are jumping in to support each other with kindness and intelligence.\n\nCheck out a few of the messages below from our school students, University students, Citizens, teachers and executives.\nCheck out our Ambassador stories map >> (https://unicircles.softr.app/ambassador-map)\n\n\n**\nEmma Tomov\n10 years old\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMexico\nIMAGI-NATION{University} School Student\nEmma dove head first into the experience of being a Global Ambassador of Equality. She is one of the most active members of the Signal groups and gave great insight to her Tutorial Group talking about her project for change. As you read through her vision below consider what kind of world we could build if more people are as kind, passionate and intelligent as Emma!\n\nWe look forward to sharing more of her story and those of the 300 + Ambassadors completing the {University} in 2022.\n\n\"As an ambassador, I would like to bring the world closer together by addressing the shame kids may experience due to the prejudice of others. No child should be shamed for their beliefs, ideas, or failures. With no shame, we could build hope. Hope is something that helps us believe and visualize our goals of being successful. We as children need to grow in a safe and accepting environment and build hope for the future. I would like to help my school and all of the students be aware of the importance of no more shame and having hope. That is why I want to be an imagination ambassador for AIME. I hope with this opportunity, I can help create an impact on the world.\"\n\n\n\n** Featured knowledge\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat to get a little taste of the knowledge that is being passed on to our Global Ambassadors?\n\nGo check out thisbeta version of an AIME App (https://aimeapp.softr.app/aime-app) where you can dig into our 18 values and listen to Mentors that have walked onto the bridge in search of a farier world.\nhttps://unicircles.softr.app/ambassador-map\nVisit the AIME App >> (https://aimeapp.softr.app/aime-app)\n\n============================================================\n** YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/aimementoring)\n** Website (https://aimementoring.com/wp1/)\n** Email (mailto:bk@aimementoring.com)\n** Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/show/7n4GZVCbEf09VDQErzbzxh?si=d65ea7ce617a4e4f)\n** AIME Shop (https://shop.aimementoring.com/)\nCopyright © *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*, All rights reserved.\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|* *|LIST:DESCRIPTION|*\n\nOur mailing address is:\n*|LIST_ADDRESS|* *|END:IF|*\n\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can ** update your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*)\nor ** unsubscribe from this list (*|UNSUB|*)\n.\n\n*|IF:REWARDS|* *|REWARDS_TEXT|* *|END:IF|*",

No longer will we be selling transactional hoodies on a shop where you can just buy a relationship with AIME.\n\nMoving forward we are building a relational map.\n\nHoodie Economics is the playground where we look at exchanges of time, knowledge and opportunities with the Hoodie as the common thread - as it has been for the last 18+ years for so many within the network.\n\nIn terms of $$ exchanges, we will only provide that opportunity to engage with a hoodie relationship when an action is activated and when there is a systemic shift at play.\n\nThere are too many clothes in the world, so we'll do our best to ReclAIME dead stock, or rework old hoodies. When you see new garments from us we'll be working on either the value returned to the world being so significant that it's worth the true cost of making the garment, or we'll be profiling innovative technology like Seaweed Hoodies (Coming in the next few months).\n\n⬇️ Below is what you can look forward to ⬇️\n\nJump on the Hoodie Economics river run below and check out the current-sea...\n\"You may have missed Episode 0 with Johny Mair from ethic (https://bmi320.wixsite.com/moah/post/moah-with-ethic) who are helping produce and bring to life the Making of a Hoodie Podcast.\n\nThe premise is - let's find a systemic challenge, weave a solution that works within and beyond the AIME system, creating short-term and long-term systemic change.\n\nAmped to bring you Episode 1 - our CO-CEO & Joy project to see 4 more Co-CEO's in the AIME system next year, and work towards 5000 JOY Corps building their own mentoring bridges, Co-CEO programs and JOY into their current-sea.\nHoodies will be available in categories as part of a made to order crowdfunded system for each project, we'll spin one up every 2-4 weeks and bring it to you on a Wednesday.\nWe are about to move into our new IMAGI-NATION{Factory} in Sydney and will open it to schools around the world to visit and the general public. This will open up by October and inside will be a moneyless shop with an IMAGINE HOPE coin.

This unprecedented move combines the creation of a new digital platform with an intentional organisational death date, ensuring AIME's decade-long focus will be on packaging and sharing universal tools for imagination, custodianship, and mentoring.\n\nFounded in 2005, AIME grew rapidly across Australia, mobilising predominantly non-Indigenous university students to mentor Indigenous high school students. Over 15 years, 25,000 Indigenous students participated, achieving educational parity, while 10,000 university students were trained as mentors.\n\nThe past eight years have seen AIME both expand and retreat - expanding its network for systemic change while stepping back to develop universal tools that can be freely shared.\n\nTwo Universal Tools Launch Today:\n* Mentorclass Curriculum (https://www.aimementoring.com/Mentorclass)\n+ Partnership with Cool.org\n+ Available to all Australian schools\n+ Embedded mentoring experience for Indigenous student engagement\n* The Mentor App (https://cool.org/aime-mentor-class-teaching-resources)\n+ Free platform organising mentoring groups\n+ Provides comprehensive mentor training\n+ Currently trialled with NYC judges and Nigerian NGOs\n+ Potential reach: 260,000 Indigenous students in Australia and millions of marginalised young people around the world\n+ Universally accessible in English\n\n\"The root cause of needing mentors is that school curriculum design and teaching training hasn't been able to access the imagination and processes to engage Indigenous kids pushed outside the margins,\" says AIME's CEO and founder, Jack Manning Bancroft. \"We hope this improves every school and every teacher in Australia can become a mentor and remove the need for mentoring organisations like AIME.\"\n\nPaul Kearney Kearney group CEO & AIME global chair said regarding the focus on tool development “the intentional death date when you think about it should be something all organisations should look to do - it focuses our attention on the tools and knowledge being passed on and makes a healthier organisational ecosystem.”\n\n\"We are proud to release the MentorClass resources as part of our partnership with AIME. These resources include four workshops and a professional learning course to empower educators to embrace their role as mentors in the classroom. It was a pleasure to work alongside the dynamic and vibrant AIME team to curate these learning experiences for students to experience an authentic mentoring experience that transforms their ways of thinking.\" - Tanna Hardinge, First Nations Education Specialist at Cool.org.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nBenjamin Knight\n\nCommunications Director, AIME\n\nbk@aimementoring.com\n\n+61 422 883 943\n\n-------------------\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\n\nAbout AIME\n\nAIME is a global systems change network creating pathways between economies that exclude nature and those that centre it. Through IMAGI-NATION, its 10-year digital nation project, AIME is bringing together 5,000 network leaders from unlikely fields - schools, business, citizens, young people, and Indigenous knowledge holders - each with the potential to influence 10,000 others. Led by Indigenous systems thinking and powered by unlikely connections, AIME develops universal tools for imagination, mentoring, and custodianship while bringing marginalised minds to the front of the design queue. As it moves toward its intentional conclusion in 2033, AIME is focused on unlocking the $750B nature repair market and creating transformative tools that will live on beyond its organisational life.\n\nResearch & Economic Impact\n\nAIME's impact has been extensively documented through rigorous academic research and economic analysis. Harvard Business School published two case studies in 2019, examining both AIME's founding journey (2005-2016) and its global expansion (2016-2017). A landmark KPMG economic evaluation in 2018-19 revealed that for every dollar invested in AIME, society receives an $8.90 return, resulting in approximately $1.17 billion in net direct economic impact annually.\n\nRecent Recognition\n* 2022: \"Top 100 Leaders in Education\" - Education 2.0 Conference, Las Vegas\n* 2021: Fast Company \"World Changing Ideas in Education\" Honourable Mention\n* 2021: Good Design Awards Australia \"Gold Award for Social Impact\"\n* 2020: UNESCO Global Education Coalition member\n* 2019: \"Top 50 Organisations in Education\" - Global Forum for Education & Learning, Dubai\n\nAccess the tools (https://www.aimementoring.com/Mentorclass)\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nBenjamin Knight\n\nCommunications Director, AIME\n\nbk@aimementoring.com\n\n+61 422 883 943\n\n-------------------\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\n\nAbout AIME\n\nAIME is a global systems change network creating pathways between economies that exclude nature and those that centre it.

We set out in an Embassy, and have deployed our mentors around the world to connect with schools and see if they would like us to come out for a day and build an imagination classroom.\n\nIt's been a fascinating design experience.\n\nOver the last 20 years we've built endless predictive programs, scripts, training tools, set outcomes.\n\nAnd we are currently fusing them to be able to live inside the system. Later this year we'll roll out IMAGI-NATION and provide the space for Universities to become accredited as Mentoring Universities, for Schools to become Imagination Schools, for organisations to become JOY Corps and for kids from outside the margins to establish custodial economies as IMAGI-NATION Presidents.\n\nThe tools we have built will go into their hands, with JOY corps delivering tutor squads to high schools, and Universities taking the AIME tools and calling their mentoring programs to high school whatever they want to call it.\n\nSo with this quest to 10,000 imagination classrooms we are looking out to a new and an old space. It's taken 20 years to realise that imagination is inbuilt in us. It's part of the design challenge implicit in the question of \"building\" an imagination classroom.\n\nI'd argue the greatest imagination classrooms are away from the screens you are reading this on and beyond the walls and roofs we've built. It's beyond the stars, deep into the core of the earth - how the heck is there molten lava beneath our feet!? Talk about internal heating...\n\nThe last few weeks here's some of the traps we've fallen into internally.\n\nWe created a Google Doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bD7Je0JLcfNpBNhpXPQJydTJTMdoqhmFUxpt4Jc_ICs/edit?usp=sharing) with the question what is an imagination classroom, and once we started to answer it, we then started to wrestle control…\n\nOkay how long will the workshop be?\n\nWhat can we tell schools an imagination classroom is?\n\nWhat can we send to them?\n\nAnd the answer unfortunately is nothing, because sometimes the very best of something comes out of doing nothing…isn't that right Pooh Bear.\n\nWe can turn up in relation, we can gather together and look out, and that is the role of the mentor. To explore, to open up new territory, to look beyond, to make sense together.\n\nFor schools looking for AIME to play back a script, we won't do that, we won't play to kids simple words to describe their identity, we won't lock them into one nation or belief system, one way or the other, mentors can't provide scripts, we can ask questions, explore, and cultivate a learning mindset.\n\nEach day on our website (https://aimementoring.com/10000-classrooms/) , there'll be a new blog, a new note in a 10 year song as we build these imagination classrooms around the world. If you'd like to go on the journey with us and be a mentor to deliver a classroom experience to a school hit us up.  (https://aimementoring.com/10000-classrooms/)\n\nMy promise to you is we won't know the answers tomorrow, and we probably won't know more than we know in 10 years time. But, we might have honed how to think.\n\nWe need to prepare a generation who are facing employment oblivion through robots and threats of lemmings walking off the wall to extinction to imagine new realities and make them real.\n\nSo tomorrow, the Embassy will roll to another school, we'll pick up the phone and open up a conversation with…\n\nDo you want us to come an build an imagination classroom? And when the teacher responds - How? - we'll reply…\n\n\"We don't know, but we'd like to work it out together.\"\n\nWe won't deliver you answers that con you to a fixed reality so when you then see complexity you feel confused. We will work on the fusion of us all together, common sense making, through imagination and we'll drop out of the con job, and focus on the fusion :)\n\nSending you all the best of vibes wherever you are reading this.\n\nJMB\n\non behalf of the AIME team\nhit us up for an imagination classroom (https://aimementoring.com/10000-classrooms/)\n\nP.S.

This semester he has grown in confidence exponentially. In particular, he often comes back from his AIME lessons and talks with great passion and excitement about the ideas and thoughts raised. During the 'Shred the Shame' lesson, he led many conversations and was very brave, vulnerable and wise in the things he shared. As a result of his growth this term, I have nominated him for a local Deadly Encouragement Award.\nThe exploring and sharing of elements of our identities, including the setting and expanding of cultural goals, has been pivotal to the social and emotional growth of my students this year/term. Celebrating differences and finding commonality has strengthened our team and given students voice and agency. This activity was a great refresher and was a task that I asked the students to also try at home with a family member or friend. It was great to hear stories later of how these discussions flowed into their homes.\"\nPS. We have a comic series inspired by the AIME Kindness Hoodie, Ntaate Laurean & the Tribe Uganda team.

Opting for growth hints at a vast economy harmonious with nature’s principles, contrasting starkly with present practices.”\n\n— Thomas Schindler\n\nIn this week’s Dinosaur Trance, Systems Change Resident, Thomas Schindler talks about the advent of a heliogenic civilisation and the critical need for a reorientation from the myopic pursuit of growth to a more enlightened symbiosis with life’s rhythms.\n\n“This shift transcends technological innovation; it’s a recalibration of our cultural and intellectual compass. It invites a redefinition of success, not as a solitary climb but as a collective journey towards holistic wellbeing.”\n\nAlso, jump into this week’s edition for the next chapter of The Adventures of Hilbert Hoodie\n\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/blog/dinosaur-trance---issue-16\nIssue #16 (https://www.aimementoring.com/blog/dinosaur-trance---issue-16)\n\nYour complete, physical copy of Dinosaur Trance can be purchased any time before Nov 15 2024, so you can receive your copy in the new year.\n\nJust click on the button below.\nOrder Dino Trance here - EOI (https://tally.so/r/wo7e7V)\n\n“The important thing isn't to achieve all your dreams, but to keep dreaming.

My mission is to find solutions for the current complexities and crises we face.\n\nAs I floated here, with open arms and my headlight on, I spotted a world full of dreams and challenges. I swam in space closer to that world and saw there was a magical troupe of diverse dreamers there!\n\nArtists, philosophers, writers, and more—they believed in the power of magic and imagination.\n\nIn this world of connectivity and isolation, excess and scarcity, destruction and hope, the dreamers envisioned a place to reshape human life on Earth—a social network for good.\n\nThey built this world.\nAnd they called it IMAGI–NATION (http://aimementoring.com) .\nEnter IMAGI-NATION (http://aimementoring.com)\nhttp://aimementoring.com\n\nI counted on all of my left fingers and for nearly four years, the dreamers crafted this magical space.\n\nThey gathered wisdom from elders, youth, and nature, creating pathways for everyone.A cross-hatched lab fusing old and new knowledges (https://mailchi.mp/aimementoring.com/launchofimagi-nation-1377918?e=bfe164836b) .\n\nInspired by Australia’s Bunya Mountains, where for thousands of years, the Indigenous people had gathered in ceremony, celebration and exchange, and guided by ancestral wisdom, this social network for good was born (https://mailchi.mp/aimementoring.com/launchofimagi-nation?e=bfe164836b) .\n\nIMAGI-NATION is much more than a digital platform; it is a global invitation to all.\n\nFor people to connect in magical ways, as citizens for change, to shift the systems of the world.\n\nFor schools to become imagination labs, cities to turn into cities of imagination, corporations to become places of joy, kindness and imagination, and festivals to transform into kindfests.\n\nIMAGI-NATION thrives on hope, kindness, and imagination, offering a space where humanity collaborates to create a fairer and kinder world.\n\nSo, the story unfolds—an enchanting journey where people from all walks of life come together to free their imagination to solve the challenges of our time.\n\n\n** Join the dreamers at IMAGI-NATION and be a part of this transformative tale.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTake the Tour of IMAGI-NATION (https://vimeo.com/874999299)\n\n⚠️ WARNING ⚠️\nIMAGI-NATION won’t last forever and it will die an intentional death on 8 August 2032.\n\n\n** I am confronted with a puzzle.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs I wander around the galaxy visiting different worlds, I’m striving to understand why, on such a magical planet like Earth, there are so many obstacles to humans\n\nflourishing and the planet thriving.\n\nWhat is missing here? Imagination?\n\nWhat needs to be done?\n\nI have made IMAGI-NATION my base as I conduct this research.\n\nOnce, with some of my fellow professors from IMAGI-NATION, I stopped in at a place on Earth where people learn to take care of themselves, each other and the planet. It is called Learning Planet, in the heart of Paris.\n\nIt’s a place where people learn to become planetizens—citizens of the world who respect and nurture life on the planet.\n\nI was so excited to meet these planetizens, we got talking about the research we can do together on some of these questions, and now I’m a visiting professor there!\n\nAnd so I’d like to invite you to the LearningPlanet Festival (https://www.learning-planet.org/learningplanet-festival/) , where you can join thousands of other planetizens in celebrating, imagining, learning and building together, as architects of a kinder, fairer world.\n\nYou’ll find these events and activations from the heart of IMAGI-NATION where you can help me find answers to some of my research questions:\n\n24 January\n\nART\n\nWhat if your art could shape the future of learning?\n\nJoin the art campaign here (https://reimaginingschools.carrd.co/#)\n\n24 January\n\nCREATIVE WRITING\n\nCan you write a story on how to design the school of your dreams?\n\nJoin the live conversation here (https://www.learning-planet.org/event/re-imagining-schools-through-creative-writing/)\n\n24 January\n\nIMAGI-NATION {TV}\n\nHow can young people unlock their full imaginative capacity to devise solutions for life on earth?\n\nJoin the live conversation here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H16nfgomtio)\n\n26 January\n\nIMAGI-NATION {TV}\n\nHow can we infuse funding with radical, hopeful imagination?\n\nJoin the live conversation here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjxu4aJGW1Q)\n\nMy fellow professors and I will be researching and testing and building around these themes for the next eight years and six months until IMAGI-NATION's sunset.\n\nLet us know about your journey of bringing imagination to foster better relations, systemic change, and collective growth on Earth.\n\nIn kindness,\n\nProfessor Galactic\n\nView email in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|**|LIST_ADDRESSLINE_TEXT|**|END:IF|*\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe (*|UNSUB|*)"

We've been working on collaborative art projects, and today Steph and I realised that there are a lot of connections between our projects in the sense of narrative. The mentoring session with the girls today was about the power of your words, based on an experiment with rice we saw. The jars that are filled with love, and given that loving energy and positive energy words stay white, and the water is clear, but the jar that is given hateful words physically changes, and either turn brown, black, or murky.\nWe decided to recreate elements of the experiment with an activity and wrote down all the “good” and “bad” words that are told to us and put them all in a journal to fix some of those bridges between the different sides of the story.\n\nIt’s been beautiful to see how young people embrace change and growth. No matter their age, no matter their gender or the languages that they speak, they all have that open dialogue at the table. All these kids and they're listening to each other actively. This space… they opened it.

Just reply to this email...a human will be on the other end super keen to hear from you.\n\n\"Whatever it is that gets your passion going, just give it a genuine crack. I have never met anyone that looks back and says I tried too hard at that. Whatever you do just have an absolute committed crack at it and you will never have to apologise\"\n\nAdam Spencer\nAustralian comedian, media personality and radio presenter\n\nTaken from AIME TV, first released on April 12, 2018\n\n\n** It’s not stuckness; it’s where the fun and magic happens\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwritten by AIME's Head of Impact, Irmin Durand\n\nSo about the book. The one we started working on back in January and then I got stuck (if you missed that part, it’s here (https://mailchi.mp/aimementoring.com/failure-time-edition-1377190?e=bfe164836b) ).\n\nTyson Yunkaporta writes in SandTalk, “somewhere between action and reaction there’s an interaction, that’s where all the magic and fun lies.”\n\nThe book we’re writing is the story of how we’d like to capture the magic moments we see happening in the world of IMAGI-NATION, to show their value and the impact they have on people.\n\nYou know those moments.\n\nYou’re in the middle of an activity or a conversation, and something goes ping! A spark. A light bulb. “Aha!” A shift happens in your mind that can have some pretty deep and wide ripple effects through your life.\n\nOr when you just click with someone. Whether you’ve just met them or you’ve known them for a while, suddenly you’re on another level with that person. You just get each other. The connection is real.\n\nWhen the Elders guide us in the old ways of knowing and relating with the world around us. Discovering something unexpected and awe-inspiring and feeling the boundaries of your mind expand. A random act of kindness that turns your day around. A really good laugh or a rich conversation and the energy they give you that trickles into other areas of your life.\n\nFor us at AIME, that’s real impact - light bulb moments, discovery, connection, our relations with others and with nature, sharing and exchanging, kindness… Things that are hard to hold, count, measure, package, even prove, but we feel them, we experience them, and they give us so much, in the moment and even years later.\n\nThat’s how we want to score ourselves on our impact over the next 10 years - the joy and energy and connection and relations happening across all the work we do in the world of IMAGI-NATION that lead to change. And as there’s no blueprint for this kind of a scoring system, we thought we’d invent one.\n\nSo that’s what our book is about - the story of inventing a way to value things that are uncountable yet immensely valuable, the thinking and learning, the inspiration and ideas, the questions and the doubts, and the crucial thing: how do we do actually do this?\n\nWe spent a couple months imagining, reading, talking, questioning, trying things, wondering, thinking hard, laughing, learning… We read some good books and articles, we listened to podcasts, we had really rich conversations with knowledge holders around the world. A huge thank you to these good humans for having shared their time, knowledge and questions with us:\n\nThen it was time to pull all the threads together, weave them into a map with a clear path forward. And that’s where the words failed me and I got stuck.\n\nWe have imagination and IMAGI-NATION. We have a vision. We have knowledge and relations and patterns. We have a garden :) We have a roadmap for our journey over the next few years. We have BRAVE goals. We have a NATION coming soon. We have good humans building alongside us. All that in one book (and ina mini website (https://aimeimpact.softr.app/aimes-impact-book/#the-weaves) )!\n\n\n\nSo how do we link it all together? How do we bring all this complex stuff into a big picture that is simple and clear and leaves space for things to emerge? How do we anchor relations-exchange-knowledge in every area of work in our roadmap? How do we connect all the elements of the NATION to the different areas of our impact garden? What are we missing? What can we do without? And how do we bring all this thinking and learning to a grand finale that does justice to all the work that’s gone into this book so far?\n\nI’m asking you all these questions. I guess if I were to condense them down into one core question it would be: what do you see as the ending for a book like this?\n\nIt’s rich, it’s complex and it’s a long read - almost 40,000 words and we haven’t finished yet.\n\nSo how would you like to see it end? And can you help us bring it all together?\n\nI’m leavingthis Google doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycf8LfqGNTlNLx6IKTgx7GRainicYYiAIQzwvz9dWRI/edit) open for three months.\n\nTake your time to read, digest, think, imagine, suggest. And then jump in. I’m really keen to hear from you and tap into the collective intelligence of good humans from everywhere on this beautiful blue dot we call home.\n\nAnd here are a few of the things I’ve learned (or remembered) while sitting in this uncomfortable space between bookends.\n\nThis is where the magic happens, where things spark and emerge and take their own shape if I let them.\n\nWriting a book like this takes a lot of letting go, failing, forgiveness and kindness.\n\nLetting it sit for a while without pushing brings the ideas and clarity out into the light, like shy little creatures in the woods :)\n\n“Where it is, is where it needs to be.” - JMB\n\nWe are always drafting, never finished, and we can always circle back and rewrite if we want (like Kiese Laymon who bought back, revised and republished a novel and essay collection years after he first published them (https://www.vox.com/2021/7/15/22577633/kiese-laymon-long-division-revised-vox-conversations)  (shout out to Hannah James for the share)\n\nLet’s think and write together and see what fun and magic happens.\n\nMuch love,\n\nIrmin\nHead of Impact\nAIME\n\n\n** Are you ready to fail?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCome fail with us and submit your failure time activity, experience or reflection to be added to our weekly mailouts.\nSubmit your failure >> (mailto:bk@aimementoring.com?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20submit%20a%20Failure%20Time%20piece%20of%20writing!)\n\n\n** Happy to help.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet us know if you have any questions.

What started as a whirlwind of activity, fuelled by three turbo charge humans and a shared belief in something bigger than ourselves (on a high floor in Sydney's Salesforce building) transformed into a \"mind being adventure\" that has at times stretched us to our limits.\n\nI often found myself teetering on the edge of my competency, questioning whether I could keep up with the pace and demands of this work.\n\nThe one thing that saved me, time and again, was the extraordinary network of people that makes up AIME - the artists, the dancers, the storytellers, the magicians, the dreamers, the puppeteers all weaving together a tapestry of change.\n\nWe gather monthly for ceremony in the water, grounding ourselves in the wisdom of the land and sea, learning from the resilience of crayweed, and finding ways to be in relation to the natural world and its profound teachings. It's in these moments of connection, surrounded by people who are as passionate and committed to this work as I am, that I find the strength to keep going, to keep believing that a different world is possible.\n\nMeasuring the impact of this work isn't easy - how do you quantify the shift in energy, the spark of imagination, the ripple effects of kindness that flow from these connections?\n\nIt's a journey we're still on, navigating uncharted territory, guided by the wisdom of 60,000+ years of Indigenous intelligence. It's a process of sitting with the discomfort of not knowing, of trusting that the answers will emerge when the time is right. It requires a willingness to step back, to listen deeply, to allow the wisdom of the world around us to guide our steps.\n\nOne of the key challenges we've faced is moving beyond traditional impact metrics to capture the full depth and complexity of our work. It’s easy to get caught up in numbers – the number of hoodies distributed, the monetary value generated, the number of people reached. While these are important indicators, they don't tell the whole story.\n\nTo address this challenge, we've embraced a multidimensional approach to impact measurement through Lightning.\n\nThis unique process draws inspiration from Indigenous knowledge systems and utilises three key components:\n\n\n** Lightning (the show) (https://www.aimementoring.com/impact)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA reflection of our values and a commitment to a different way of thinking about impact. We are moving away from transactional models of impact measurement and embracing a relational approach that recognises the interconnectedness of everything.\n\n\n** The Message Stick JOY Report (https://www.aimementoring.com/impact)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis physical artefact, carved with nine impact indicators, serves as a tangible reminder of the context and interconnectedness of our work. It grounds us in the story of our impact and helps us to see beyond mere data points.\n\nThis report focuses on relational wealth and the intangible aspects of our impact. It delves into the human connections, the shared experiences, and the ripple effects of our work that are often difficult to quantify but are essential to lasting change.\n\n\n** The Hoodie Stock Exchange (https://www.aimementoring.com/impact)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis platform visualises the progress of our various systems change projects. It’s a dynamic representation of how our work is unfolding in real-time, capturing the energy and momentum of our collective efforts.\n\nWe believe that true impact emerges from the energy between people, the stories we share, and the relationships we build. It's about the ripple effects that extend far beyond any single project or initiative.\n\nAs we look to the future, Lightning will continue to evolve alongside AIME. We are committed to constantly learning, adapting, and refining our approach to impact measurement, ensuring that it remains a powerful tool for guiding our work and demonstrating the transformative power of imagination, mentoring, and custodianship.\n\nThis journey will undoubtedly have its challenges, as we grapple with issues of sustainability, engagement, and translating complex ideas into accessible forms. But we maintain that sense of adventure and openness to the unexpected, then the path ahead, while uncertain, will be anything but boring. It will be a symphony of collective imagination, a vibrant tapestry woven from the threads of unlikely connections.\n\nThank you for being part of this journey.\n\nYours in imagination,\n\nBenjamin\n\nAIME chronicler\nWatch Lightning (https://www.aimementoring.com/impact)\n\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

The most prominent of these is the gene for oxytocin.\n\nOxytocin makes us love more, cuddle more, and it makes us kind. It is one of our oldest genes, at around 500 million years young.\n\nIt causes mothers to love and care for their children, thus ensuring that they grow up and are able to reproduce themselves, thus carrying on the human species.\n\nIt also causes us to help each other, to work together for a common good.\n\nSo rather than being selfish, kindness is genetically ‘wired’ in us.\n\nOur kind nature is deeply entrenched in us.\n\nSoooooo, it’s time to shout out all the kind people around Australia to help us remember why we are born kind.\nNominate a kind person (https://www.aimefactory.com/humankindvikp)\n\nThis Sunday we want to remind you what’s at our core by working with the Human Kind Festival (https://www.humankind.sydney/) in Sydney to\n\ngive away 3 day tickets to the full festival to kind humans\n\nIf you or someone in Sydney want to attendHuman Kind (https://www.humankind.sydney/) 16-18 March click here (https://www.aimefactory.com/humankindvikp) .\n\nThat’s 3 days of 50+ world-class speakers, transformative experiences, keynote addresses, interactive workshops, pitch competitions, art installations, music showcases and so much more.\n\nLet’s all turn this festival into the kindness gathering of people in the world!\nhttps://www.aimefactory.com/humankindvikp\n\n—-Now, as a little kindness reminder—-\n\nFor so long now, have been working to put kindness at the centre of our daily lives and inspiring others to do the same.\n\nHere is a 5 minutes gift to walk through our AIME’s kindness journey.\n\nAs you feel the warmth of kindness, come back to click through (https://www.aimefactory.com/humankindvikp) and gift a special person in your life a ticket to Human Kind.\n\nFor 6 years AIME has been sharing stories of kindness - you can catch all 100 of them here (https://aimementoring.com/68-2__trashed/humankind-kindhuman/) .\n\nOn July 7 2017, from Sunrise to Sunset, we lit up the nation with letters of kindness as AIME Hoodie Day delivered the love to everyday Australians.\nhttps://vimeo.com/238013083/477f462775\n\nIn 2021 we sent 20 hoodies around the world to see how much kindness could be shared. Check out 1000’s of miles travelled and the hours and hours kindness achieved here (https://hdpledges.softr.app/) (includes out full archive of Sunday kindness mailouts).\n\nDuring Hoodie Day 2022 we asked our network for pledges of kindness and were blown away by hundreds of kind responses.

Jack Manning Bancroft digs deep into the critical conversations with Steph Beck, Eddie Uini, Nia Lewis, Menaka Wijesinha, Aston Hawkins-Nicholls, and Abby Prades.\n\nWe ask you to take off your shoes, find a quiet corner in nature, and feel the ground with your bare feet. Come with us as we lean into Indigenous systems thinking. What is a Global Ambassador of Equality? What is IMAGI-NATION{University}? And how can we change systems to leave a strong impact and lasting legacy for humanity?\n\nThe background image above is the work of Steph Beck. Artist, mother, mentor and Vice-chancellor of IMAGI-NATIO{University}.\nCheck out MOAH Episode #3 and buy a hoodie (https://www.moah.earth/post/ambassadors)\n“Today we are focusing on making a hoodie about ambassadors, about Ambassadors of Equality, about people that stand up to be mentors and try and see change through their own imagination and then go out and do it and make it come to life. And I'm very excited today to be able to have the chance to hang out with Steph Beck, who has become a pretty serious ambassador in the AIME world.”\n\nJack mb\naime founder and ceo\n\n\n** 👋  Hello!\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you haven’t had a chance to meet Steph, yet – she is Australia's first Aboriginal Vice-Chancellor of AIME’s IMAGI-NATION{University}.\nTake a peek into Steph’s VC diary (https://www.moah.earth/post/ambassadors)\n\n\"Seeing this relational network unfold while building, shaping and guiding it has been such a life-changing experience.\n\nThe UNCx5 Groups allow for complexity, depth in knowledge exchange and joy, I think these connection points are a unique combination that helps us build those bridges between the imagining and the doing.\n\nThe different perspectives the Ambassadors allow me to think through have by far been the most valuable thing I’ve gained this year, it’s generated so much hope within me that so many people understand the need for this type of community and self-directed learning.\"\n\nStephani Beck\nVice-Chancellor IMAGI-NATION{University}\nhttps://www.moah.earth/post/this-hoodie-makes-co-ceo-s\nAs with all AIME Making of a Hoodie Episodes, you have three ways to get involved.\n\nOne to support the AIME world, one to create systematic change and one to move that change well into the future for future generations to enjoy.\n\nClick through on the banners below to show your support!\nhttps://shop.aimementoring.com/products/2022-ambassador-hoodie?utm_source=copyToPasteBoard&utm_medium=product-links&utm_content=web\nmailto:bk@aimementoring.com?subject=I%20am%20keen%20on%20the%20framed%20Ambassador%20Hoodie&body=Hit%20me%20with%20more%20info!\nJust so ya know - the above is just a mock up.

We build bridges between ourselves and the students, the students and the world, students and other students, and between ourselves and our colleagues. I think that if we weren't trying to create connections we would fail as educators. Everything and everyone are connected in some way but it is just a matter of finding that bridge and removing whatever it is that is stopping us from connecting in meaningful ways... I guess that's why I kind of think it is part of my job.\n\nI delivered a few lessons at the very beginning of the program, but I do plan to do them again now that I have an even better understanding of the action library.\n\nCreating connections is one of the ways we can work to solve major problems in the world.\"\n\nSabina Dzihic\nTeacher {Ambassador} Australia.\nRead more about our IMAGI-NATION{University} Teachers on our blog!

And allows for the dollar to be able to encapsulate a broader set of value exchange pathways into fields of nature, kindness, joy, and provides passages for us to unlock the largest source of intelligence on earth, the marginal intelligence, over 4 billion people not employed, and millions of species not currently valued in pathways of financial exchange.\n\nEach citizen unlocks Hoodie Tokens inside IMAGI-NATION - the digital hoodies are banked into a Passport for trade for jobs, opportunities, knowledge and exchange. And a physical hoodie, of which it’s value will emerge during the lifecycle of IMAGI-NATION, and after it’s death - we believe it will have artistic value as a limited supply, a high level of reputational credit, and an artistic value may all contribute to it’s worth.\n\nBelow are the economies (And their current or projected potential value) that we believe Hoodie Tokens will be tradable in FIAT systems, and the emerging economies where we will require the citizens of IMAGI-NATION to move the first dollar onto the ledger to create a case study, to open the door for the river to run between the emerging market fields. The IMAGI-NATION citizens are the first movers, or amongst the first movers in establishing these marketplaces. We are committed to not having another abstracted marketplace, but having translation across existing financial institutions and models, and into parallel web based and reputational economies. Imagination is the space between, for us as a species, and the IMAGI-NATION economy is playing that role.\n\nYou will also see the emerging marketplaces for trade and we have labelled how they verify value, whether it’s peer reviewed and open source, supply and demand driven between customer and product, endorsed by experts or a combination.\n\nHoodie Economics, the Hoodie Token, provides a token for us to fuse these spaces in between, to organise with different models of validation, from marketing crowd based models that can be emotionally driven or logically driven, through to government validation in the form of taxation, or incentives, and into corporate governance and what we report as success on the balance sheets, our job, as it has been since the AIME Hoodie was born, is to be a translator of value, between what’s inside and what’s outside the margins.\n\nWe will be verifying the value of the token with a combination of human organising patterns, by fusing Indigenous kinship mapping models with Robin Dunbar’s relational patterns, and borrowing from academic peer review modelling, self governance, responsibility and trust. We have created a pathway where there is a combination of self driven action, which is automated in its deposit process, through to an unlikely connections x 5 peer review system.\n\nThis is important to understand as it models our commitment to a decentralised yet still accountable and responsible network and economy.\n\nAnd the ultimate lever we are looking to in terms of if we endorse VISA holders and grant their final verification of the highest order, which will come in the form of a physical hoodie will be there proven and/or potential capacity for being a trading beacon for the fusion into these new marketplaces and if they have moved the relation into translation with the financial.\n\nIf the $$ don’t move Hoodie Economics will be another feel good movement for those in the know. We’ve gotta change where we place our attention, value, knowledge, time, that’s economics, and that’s the prize of the century ahead.\n\nWelcome to Hoodie Economics, Welcome to IMAGI-NATION.\n\nThe first 5 Action VISAs are now officially open globally - all the best with your application, we have released 50 to start with a focus on managing our capacity for increase of value growing at the rate of relations (to see the release dates of further VISAS and our 9 year map of increase check here).\n\nOnce we commence the first round of VISAs and build the capacity pathway we will move from the one to one relational, and look to scale opportunities for VISAs to move faster and more openly globally, for example we may end up offering 1M IMAGI-NATION President VISAs in the final year.\n\nThe ultimate prize for us is the relational knowledge being deep, the mentoring mindset of holding value and ethics and morals for usall being centred, our understanding of our role as a species as custodians being an anchor point, our capacity to utilise the deepest human intelligence - imagination being practised and activated, and our ability to use these relational fundamentals to be a translator and connect to who we don’t know and what we don’t know with kindness and curiosity, to be an expert in unlikely connections, and from those deep long foundations, then we can measure the trade translation to the movement and activation of financial capital into nature and beyond.\n\nFor our AIME friends, this commences a weekly Hoodie Economics edition, where we’ll focus on one of the Hoodie Tokens, and its impact in translation between the financial and the relational.\n\nWe are committed in the next 9 years and then beyond after we hand on the notes and the knowledge and legacy is handed on, to improving the lives of billions of people, millions of species, and unlocking over a trillion $ of untapped wealth sitting between the markets of today, yesterday and tomorrow.\n\nHere’s to the space between.\n\nJack Manning Bancroft\n\n7th April, 2024 (announcing the opening of IMAGI-NATION action VISAs to the world)\nhttps://aimementoring.com mailto:bk@aimementoring.com\n\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

We've been working our butts off looking to light up a pathway for Indigenous kids in Australia to be able to take on the world - we've now built a network for them to play in and to lead the change - it's called IMAGI-NATION.\n\nWe believe imagination outshines knowledge any day. Our Indigenous systems are bursting with big stories and wisdom that can only be unlocked with our full imaginative powers.\n\nFor the last half of this year, we're on a mission to share our discoveries with your students. But we're not just sharing - we're bringing the full force of magic and wonder!\n\nPicture this: a 15-minute explosion of imagination at your school assembly, led by our dream team of world-class mentors and master storytellers. We'll crack open the hearts and minds of students and teachers alike, letting imagination run wild.\n\nWant to meet the magical beings behind this adventure?\n\n🦸🏽‍♀️ Here's a sneak peek at our team and their superpowers 🦸🏽‍♀️\n\nI'm Jack, I started AIME and have helped build IMAGI-NATION.\n\nI've written a couple of children’s books IMAGI-NATION & The Eagle Inside and a big book called Hoodie Economics - I'd love to bring some down with me to the school.\n\nI puppeteer with Hope who is the Professors of IMAGI-NATION at IMAGI-NATION{University} and Hope will be with me as part of the show. I'll come visit your school and bring some of my imagination mentor friends. Here's a pic of me with Hope below.\n\nNow I'll introduce you to some of my friends below.\n\nMeet Waany, who moves as if he's water on land. I love bringing the soul of the story to life with Waaneenga Blanco who has repped Bangarra as a lead and travelled the world. He now dances with the IMAGI-NATION troupe to wake up human kind and help find the path.\n\nMeet Stephanie Beck, the IMAGI-NATION{University} Vice Chancellor who has the privilege to work with all of our Professors. Stephanie is a brilliant mapper and drawer and may be drawing in real time as part of the show and might even be bringing breathe into the experience with Professors Song.\n\nMeet Yolande, who is maybe actually magic. Yol sings, dances, writes, and breathes life into the world through her soul and movement - I'm very very lucky to move with Yol. She also spent a serious amount of her life with Bangarra awakening tales at home and across the seas.\n\nMeet Vanessa Ellis, who has puppeteered across the globe including a Dinosaur Giant Show in Germany! Ness makes all of our Puppets and works with Professor Einstein and is an absolute gem of a human being and mentor.\n\nMeet Alejandro, who is our friend from Costa Rica, and Ale is a magician. He'll be in Australia during October/November and will join some of the school shows during that time. Ale gives us all permission to play all day :)\n\nMeet Arthur Little, who spent a lifetime in professional sport, and has been a mentor his whole life. Arthur has been an AIME Mentor for what feels like a lifetime. Arthur works with the clapsticks and with big energy to help us bring in the frequency and flow together in relation.\n\nThis is just a taste of the magical crew ready to spark imagination in your school assembly!\n\nLettuce know if you'd like us to swing by and light up your school with smiles. And hey, this is just the beginning – we've got a treasure trove of ways we can dive deeper and play together afterward.\n\nWe're also super pumped to collaborate with your local storytellers, magicians, and young talents. Got dancers, singers, or musicians in your school? Let's weave their magic into our story and put on a show for everyone – or come back for an encore performance. The possibilities are as limitless as our imagination! :)\n\nSending you the best of vibes for the week ahead.\n\nLooking forward to the weave.\n\nYoway\n\nJack Manning Bancroft\nAIME CEO and Founder\nmailto:bk@aimementoring.com https://www.aimementoring.com/\n\nView email in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|**|LIST_ADDRESSLINE_TEXT|**|END:IF|*\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe (*|UNSUB|*)"

Listening and sharing love. Was in the juvenile detention centre yesterday. Struck me how it should be normal to visit kids and adults in prison if they are near where we live. Just to hang out, be in relation. A wise person said to me after, maybe we just don't need prisons.\n\nWe wish for you human kind, me and all the Professors, freedom from the prison of your minds, we wish for you to wander in your dreams.

Two weeks ago we almost cancelled IMAGI-NATION TV because we couldn’t work out the tech side. Instead we gathered and did it - we stumbled and bumbled and we moved the thinking.\n\nWe published a text, we picked up a song note and answered the call of emerging and existing leaders around the\n\nworld and then made a short animated film in a week for them…\n\n…so here’s the world premiere (https://vimeo.com/1039185453?share=copy) below.\n\nAlso make sure you check out the making of here (https://youtu.be/O1dn7NasCzE?si=paYdURYY0-wOPDfs) .\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/1039185453?share=copy\nWatch the premiere of the MIRACLE Factory (https://vimeo.com/1039185453?share=copy)\n\nWe wish for you release from the prison of distraction.\n\nAsterix launching IMAGI-NATION TV at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney, Saturday the 26th October 2024\nRead more about the launch (https://www.aimementoring.com/carnival-of-clowns)\n\nWe wish for you a return to nature in your economies.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/1038404986/357055e65d\nWatch the Sea the weed latest video (https://vimeo.com/1038404986/357055e65d)\n\nWe send you love, we send you Hope, we send you on this Sunday as our final mailout, we send you the deepest connection from our spirits as the Professors, as non Humans, to access us, and open your minds to what's possible.\n\nStrategy day, Thursday 28th November 2024, with non human entities taking the lead…The Professors intelligence channeled\n\nWe believe in you. Keep doing the work. Find each other. Find the other species. Feel the galaxy.\n\nIMAGI-NATION the digital nation takes on it's first significant co-hort of Action VISA holders starting end of January next year, and there's plenty of action we have planned, actionable change.\n\nYou humans can talk talk talk, keep searching across the bridge of fear and the unknown to the do do do.\n\nI remember when the humans inside AIME Made that leap at Human Kind festival last year - they said three words to each other and it unlocked their super power to be in relation and be a troupe, they said the words again and again \"I don't know\" and met the person that did, or they agreed to go forth into the unknown together, to sense make, then make sense.\n\nTo end the year we share with you IMAGI-NATION Gallery - which the AIME team have answered the challenge to centre Art at the start of design, they aren't doing it chasing the painting as the thing to desire or sell, but embracing paint and art as the process of intelligence. En- JOY.\n\nSee you on the other side,\n\nProfessors Asterix\n\nProfessor of Hoodie Economics\n\nP.S.

The Visa office is here to walk the path with you so reach out when the energy sparks.”\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream\n\nThe IMAGI-NATION Visa office\n\n\n** Weaving a New Economic Fabric\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine a hoodie that's a symbol of a revolutionary economic model.\n\nAs an IMAGI-NATION President you take part in a 10-year research project with young Indigenous changemakers to stitch together a new economic tapestry - one that values our relationship with nature as much as profit margins.\n\nHere's the thread count of this unique hoodie:\n1. Who Can Wear It: Young people aged 12-30 who've been pushed to the edges of society's fabric. Whether you're from a historically marginalised group or a young person inheriting a climate-challenged world, this hoodie is designed for you.\n2. The Hoodie's Purpose: As an IMAGI-NATION President, your hoodie isn't just for keeping warm - it's a uniform for redesigning our economic wardrobe. You'll be tasked with creating \"custodial economies\" - economic models that treat nature as a partner, not a resource to be exploited.\n3. The Fabric of Custodianship: This hoodie reminds us that we're not separate from nature - we're woven into its very fabric. It's about understanding that knowledge, like the threads of a hoodie, isn't meant to be hoarded but shared freely.\n4. Measuring the Fit: Your journey will be measured not by how much you take, but by how much you give:\n+ People reconnected with nature\n+ Time spent in nature\n+ Money moved towards nature-centric projects\n+ Sharing your designs for a healthier economic network\n5. The $900 Billion Challenge: Imagine if your hoodie could redirect $900 billion back to nature. That's the scale of change we're talking about. It's not about patching up the old economic outfit - it's about weaving a completely new one.\n6. The Pattern for Change: We're putting the needle and thread in the hands of those who'll inherit this Earth. You'll be translating ancient wisdom into modern patterns, creating a new economic fashion that never goes out of style.\n7. The Final Collection: After 10 years, we'll have created more than just a new economic wardrobe. We'll have:\n+ A co-created 'how-to' book for future generations\n+ Redirected attention and money back to nature\n+ Developed a healthy social network with new rules for connection\n+ Secured the health of land and its bioregions\n+ Re-established humans as custodians of nature\n+ Moved young people from protest to impactful action\n\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\n\nReady to slide into something more imaginative?\n\nThis is your golden ticket to strut your stuff in IMAGI-NATION! 🎟️\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\n\n\n** 23rd Session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** New York, April 2024\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe had the chance to send a few Australian change makers and we will be reflecting on the journey during this week in Dinosaur trance and The Friday Act.\n\nThe 23rd Session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII 23) focused on the theme, ‘Enhancing Indigenous Peoples’ Right to Self-determination in the Context of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: Emphasising the Voices of Indigenous Youth’.\n\n**The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) was established the PFII in July 2000 to advise the UN system on Indigenous Peoples’ issues.\n\n\"Being in that space with not only the peers that I got to travel over with, but being in a space with Indigenous people from around the world was just something I'll never forget, because of the energy of that room. Everybody was there with their own story, with their own struggle, with their own fight, and they were there with a voice to be heard on the issues that are affecting them.\"\n\nSuzie Winkelman\n\nAIME Co-CEO\n\nSuzie at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York\n\nThe AIME crew of Indigenous leaders at UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\n\n\n** A few words from Professor Hope\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Well, well, well, my dear dreamweavers and future-shapers! These young custodians of tomorrow are like gardeners of joy, planting seeds of change in the soil of today's challenges. With every idea they nurture, every connection they forge, they're knitting together a tapestry of hope that stretches across continents!\n\nRemember, my imagination astronauts, Your baton is your creativity, your orchestra is the chorus of voices from around the world, and your music?

A ferry moves gently across the water. Jack, wearing a yellow shirt with \"mentor\" on the back, stands on the deck, looking out at the rising sun.\n\nNarrator: Today, we kickstart AIME's first IMAGI-NATION Club of Unlikely Connections—a monumental moment in our journey to reshape the world. Today presented to you through \"The Friday Act,\" a 511-act play where diverse minds are draw together to tackle the greatest challenges of our time.\n\nJack (reflective): The sun rose 20 years ago on a Friday in May. It had been raining. At 7:25 am, I was riding a ferry to Taronga Zoo across Sydney’s harbour. Grandfather Sun had risen. I could see other young people wearing yellow shirts with “mentor” on the back. We were nervous. We were starting something: we’d invited people we didn’t know, to meet us, kids from the other side of the uni tracks, unlikely connections.\n\nThe stage lights highlight other mentors, also in yellow shirts, mingling and looking anxious.\n\nJack (continuing): On that day, in that moment, I had zero idea what would happen next—whether anyone would show up, whether it would be a breakdown of communication, whether there would be chaos, and the big question: whether what we were doing would change anything at all.\n\n\n** Scene 2: Reflections on Impact\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe backdrop shifts to the Taronga Zoo, with a group of mentors and students interacting. Jack steps forward, centre stage.\n\nJack (inspired): I am profoundly struck by the magnitude of this morning in my life and the life of AIME. I’m struck by the theatre of it—the Friday in May, the sun returning, the unknown. I’m struck by Taronga somehow being a part of the story again for the first time in 18 or so years—with Jane Goodall meeting us there in a few weeks with our systems change residents.\n\nImages of Margaret Mead and Jane Goodall appear on a screen behind Jack.\n\nJack (quoting): I’m struck by Margaret Mead’s words again: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.”\n\nJack (passionate): And I’m struck by the fragility and bravery to birth ideas, to birth spaces, to not be sure 100 percent but to go anyway.\n\n\n** Scene 3: Entering IMAGI-NATION\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe stage transforms into a vibrant, imaginative world representing IMAGI-NATION. Bright colours and abstract shapes fill the stage.\n\nJack (enthusiastic): I think it’s really something that we are entering IMAGI-NATION today—there will be bugs, and I hope so deeply you fall in love with the beauty of the world we’ve crafted. It’s been thinking about you all the time, about you and all the other species you share this rock with. It’s been made with love and with the intent to be a safe place for ideas and action on the internet.\n\nJack (hopeful): And heck, you know—this could just be such a special memory for us all in time. A simple web page, a different destination on the map. We’ve seen what others can do. Now we get our chance.\n\nThe backdrop changes to a welcoming scene with a banner that reads \"Welcome to IMAGI-NATION Opening Day.\"\n\nJack (inviting): Welcome to IMAGI-NATION Opening Day. I can’t wait to see you all there. Thank you for sitting on the ferry with me and Stuart Reeves in the space between.\n\n\n** Scene 4: The Call to Action\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe stage shifts to a blend of the real and the imaginative, showing people from various professions.\n\nNarrator: In a world where the economy feels rigged, where the rules seem stacked against the many and in favour of the few, we yearn for transformative change. What if we could rewrite those rules? What if the economy served people, not just profits?\n\nJack (passionate): IMAGI-NATION is a digital country fuelled by 60,000 years of Indigenous wisdom and the boundless power of imagination. It's a place where relationships matter more than margins, where creativity is the ultimate resource, and where we all have a stake in shaping the future.\n\nNarrator: At the core of IMAGI-NATION is Hoodie Economics, a transformative philosophy advocating that the economy should uplift humanity, not just serve the powerful. It's about recognising the immense wealth of knowledge within every community, the untapped potential of our youth, and the wisdom of the earth itself.\n\nJack (imagining): Imagine being part of a system where:\n* 1,000 Indigenous Knowledge Labs spark innovation and environmental stewardship worldwide.\n* Young people from marginalised communities rise to leadership, driving change from the ground up.\n* Every person, in every corner of the globe, has a seat at the table and a voice that matters.\n\nNarrator: This isn't just a dream—it's a reality taking shape right now. And we need your thread in the tapestry.\n\nJack (inviting): Join us (https://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office) in this grand reimagining. Apply for your IMAGI-NATION visa (https://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office) today and stay tuned to \"The Friday Act\"—a movement that is rewriting the rules of the economy and reweaving the fabric of our world.\n\nNarrator: Whether you are a coder, a teacher, an artist, or an activist, your unique skills are crucial to this mission. Together, we can forge an economy that nurtures the world with care rather than constrains it. Let's reimagine our world, together.\n\nJack (concluding): Apply for your IMAGI-NATION visa now (https://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office) . Wear the hoodie. Join the movement. Let's reimagine the world, together.\n\nNarrator: With hope and determination.\n\nCurtains close as the audience applauds.\n\nOriginal artwork by Stephanie Beck\n\n“Been sitting and thinking deeply on this as the sun rose today, this is big this is small and everything in between. We are breathing life into new/ old ceremonies, Love being here with you all 💕”\n\nHappy IMAGI-NATION Day Fam ✨\n\nStephanie Beck\n\nVice Chancellor of IMAGI-NATION {University}\nhttps://aimementoring.com/\nSee the IMAGI-NATION TOUR VIDEO (https://aimementoring.com/)\n\nView email in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|**|LIST_ADDRESSLINE_TEXT|**|END:IF|*\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe (*|UNSUB|*)"

Some of the impact to date includes:\n* 8,000 m2 of crayweed has been restored and is continuing to expand.\n* A reversal of local extinction of crayweed in Sydney and re-establishment of crayweed forests in 7 reefs.\n* This work has led to 15 scientific articles published in top, peer-reviewed, international, scientific journals, which have been cited over 400 times in other scientific publications.\n* Operation Crayweed expect just one site to reach half a hectare in 5 to 10 years, which, alone, would sequester up to 200 kg of carbon.\n* In a study published in 2020, Kelp Forest Restoration in Australia, Operation Crayweed was judged the most successful marine restoration project in Australia to date.\n\nWant even more facts and data?

I first met AIME as a shy and reserved 17 year old in High School and throughout the last 8 years I’ve been fortunate enough to take the program to new places, meet young leaders from around the world and deliver on our promise of giving responsibility for the solution to the person thought of as problem, so they can lead and implement change.\n\nWhat is art to you? Why do you create?\nArt is a form of expression that allows us to communicate complex emotions and ideas. To me, art is a way to connect with others and express myself in a way words cannot.\nI create art for a variety of reasons, including as a form of self-expression, storytelling, communication, social cohesion, cultural identity, and therapy.\n\nWhat does it feel like to be featured on the IMAGI-NATION Totem Hoodie?\nIt’s epic! What an awesome blend of art, culture, people and story being combined and shared.\n\nWhat does it feel like to share the canvas, being the hoodie, with artists from around the globe?\nWhen you share your work with people from different parts of the world and it comes together to create one unifying piece of work it's a pretty special blend of how art resonates with different people, a fuse of cultures and backgrounds and a whole lotta narrative and story.\n\nWhat does this hoodie mean to you?\nThis hoodie is important because it creates community and shared experiences. It brings in people and assists them to find common ground.\n\nWhere do you see this hoodie in 20 years time?\nIn 20 years time, I see this as a symbol for Hoodie Economics, inspiring people to take action and make positive changes in their lives or world around them.\n\nView this email in your browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n\nGot a question?\nEmail Bobo (mailto:bk@aimementoring.com)\nLogo\n\nCopyright © *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*, All rights reserved.\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|* *|LIST:DESCRIPTION|*\n\nOur mailing address is:\n*|LIST_ADDRESS|* *|END:IF|*\n\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe from this list (*|UNSUB|*) .\n\n*|IF:REWARDS|* *|REWARDS_TEXT|* *|END:IF|*",

I wrote it for usall, to not get stuck in the problems, and try to find systemic solutions.\n\nI hope it's a helpful tool for many of you (we'll share a couple of words from Tys Yunkaporta on the book next week).\n\n2) Hoodie Day becomes Hoodie Month\n\nFrom September 1 we are going to be inviting all of you who have an AIME Hoodie, from mentors, to mentees, to friends, and systems designers, to dust it off and get your mentoring skills ready to get active again.\n\nThe first *VISA's we'll be offering publicly for citizens of earth to enter *IMAGI-NATION will be a MENTOR VISA. For Mentors to put their hand up to lead a Tutor Squad for a local school, and for Schools to put their hand up to ask for Mentors. ANYONE immediately keen to be a mentor again with a school with a Hoodie - hit us up (reply to this email) and we'll make a fun mashup video of ya'll to help visualise the road ahead.\n\nInside IMAGI-NATION one of the tools we've built is a *JOBS and Opportunities board to connect intelligence from outside the margins with those inside the margins at scale. The Mentor Opportunity will be the first gig on the Meeting Place (Jobs Ops board) inside IMAGI-NATION.\n\n3) Hooded Flow into launch of IMAGI-NATION\n\nWe'll be migrating our systems change partners, leaders from around the world, and our lead mentors to Australia for a journey across the country, *a Hooded Flow.\n\nIf you'd like us to visit your school lettuce know, we are doing it grapevine style. We'll then flow to South East Queensland, and down through my home country, Bundjalung country, through to Gadigal to then open up IMAGI-NATION to the world - a new nation without borders, a systems change playground, a knowledge economy, a home for usall to get to work for the next 9 years to shift the way we work and solve these seemingly intractable challenges. Working to fuse the intelligence beyond our *default settings, to the outside our scope of understanding.\n\n4) Imagination Residencies\n\nIf you are a school hit us up if you'd like us to be a resident in your school and we'll see what we can weave.\n\nIntroducing the 2024 Map\n\n1. January/Feb\n\nThe Learning Planet Festival in Paris\n\n2. Feb-May\n\nWe begin our work accrediting Councils in Imagination and JOY and mentoring - hit us up if you're a council that would like to secure us next year as a resident.\n\n3. June-July\n\nWe'll travel to 5 cities a fusion of usall to share and shape big story - if you are a city that would like to host us hit us up.\n\n4. August\n\nReturn to Garma as we have for the last 4-5 years to help lead the Youth Forum.\n\n5. September\n\nHoodie Month will call in the Mentors to be matched with the Schools - Dust off those Hoodies.\n\n5. August -September\n\nA number of our team will be with Organisations as Joy Corp residence.\n\n(Yes we put in two 5's)\n\n6. October\n\nMigration to Australia - bringing the world leaders to engage in our deep systems intelligence\n\n7. October-December\n\nSchool Residencies\n\nWe're pumped to roll out the different VISA types.\n\nFrom Kindness visas fusing the VIKP (Very Important Kind People) around the world, to Systems Change leaders.\n\nWe are amped to release the *IMAGI-NATION President VISAs for young people pushed outside the margins to establish custodial economies.\n\nWe are stoked to offer the chance for organisations to move from transactional to relational via Joy Corps.\n\nWe can't wait to build imagination embassies with councils around the world.\n\nWe are excited to unearth and fuse the relations between *10000 Indigenous knowledge systems labs to start to enter the start of the design queue and move on the the age of the consulting empires.\n\nAnd we can't wait to release the deep tools we've been working on like IMAGINE Film fusing the thinking of so many of you during the first year of the pandemic, through to Tys Yunkaporta's Podcast into an animated deep time Indigenous Systems text that ya'll can watch with your families and team members at work.\n\nWe are doing all of this, with a smaller team that ever, because we realised we are in relation to a system of organisations, and when we don't try to build empires, but cross hatch, we can sustain life healthily for 60,000 continuous years and more.\n\nSending you all great vibes.\n\nJMB\n\np.s. we are 150K of the 1M raise for Operation Crayweed to reforest Sydney's Coastline over the next 10 years. Stay tuned for ‘Into the Weeds’ with Brenden Newton coming out monthly on a Saturday to ya'll to update on this 10 year journey. Seaweed Hoodies should arrive end of October for the first batch of peeps that ordered them - slow fashion :)\n\n* if some of the concepts and terminology in the letter spark excitement, confusion, contemplation, energy or you are just not sure what is going on….we would love to be in relation with you by email, phone or whatever works best. If you are willing to walk halfway across the bridge we will meet you there ;)\nAIME team\n\nAbove are some of the AIME crew sense making on walls in Sydney this week\n\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

It's a whole world of imagination and ideas. Tie them with words and you are reading someone else's mind when you read a book and it's even more so than when you watch a movie which is an hour half or two hours of spectacle and explosions and jokes.\n\nWhen you read a book you really get the chance to enter into someone's mind and how they think.\n\nThe other thing I would say is, it sounds like a cliché, but try to be true to yourself and to ask the questions of yourself\n\nWhat interests me?\nWhat do I love?\nWhat do I hate?\nWhat are some of the things that I 100% do not want to do when I grow up?\n\nMake that list and then keep looking at that list because you can't ever go back!\"\n\nTaken from IMAGI-NATION{TV} Episode #1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4MRUg-7Vmw) - Aired March 23, 2020\nhttps://youtu.be/c0b17FrFdrE\nTake the time to listen to the next round of amazing AIME Global Ambassadors of Equality catching up with IMAGI-NATION{University} Vice-Chancellor Steph Beck.\n\nJust before we went live Ernesto asked if we find anyone that could translate for him. Two hours later AIME Ambassador Fernandez was on the show and you can see for yourself the incredible job that they did!\n\n\"People who can afford institutes where they can learn English need to pay a lot of money and those who can't afford that basically, are left behind. My great purpose is to help them get that for free...I would like to help Latinos who only speak Spanish and are not able to access an English education break those barriers in order for them to access quality education\"\n\nErnesto\nGlobal Ambassador of Equality\nCuzco, Peru\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur guests and host\nSteph - IMAGI-NATION{University} Vice-Chancellor\nErnesto - School Student Peru\nFernandez - School Student Peru\nJumana - School student Egypt\nWatch the show >> (https://youtu.be/c0b17FrFdrE)\nWe wanted to make sure you didn't miss Fernandez's  (https://vimeo.com/708492318/e76dadc827) Global Ambassador of Equality application.

I am a student entrepreneur and a part of AIME under the filmmaking course. As an individual, while exploring my work life and ethics, I believe I found that I particularly value passion, hard work, creativity and imagination. As well as personally caring about kindness, bravery, independence, and knowing one's worth.\n\nMy brave goals... Hmm... I have a lot. I not only want to expand my business and reduce inequalities in the sector of arts and media. I want to scale the organisation that I'm working on so I can help solve some of the major global goals.\n\nI hope to collaborate with people from around the world and make them a part of the changemakers' community and eventually, when I grow up, buy a large piece of land, build my house there and with the land that's left train people so that they can start their own change-making journeys.\"\n\nRead Sagnik's Honours Submission >> (https://imagi-nation-labs.softr.app/ambassador-sagnik)\nAIME team refection on Sagnik's year at IMAGI-NATION{University}\n\n\"Sagnik, what a beautiful, rich and inspiring lesson: \"Imagination for me is color. It paints my blank canvas with millions of beautiful hues and makes me dream. It makes me build something out of nothing. It makes me create something for the ones who have long forgotten how to dream.\" You have a gift for storytelling and motivational thought.\n\nThank you for taking us through part of the journey of creating your change project and shooting for the moon. Your submission shines a spotlight on values and lessons that are a huge part of IMAGI-NATION and it's great to see you live these values and lessons in the process of creating your change project.\n\nThere's a lot of courage, humanity and resilience in your story. I've enjoy learning alongside you and being mentored by you as I read your submission.

And then the ocean gifted me an encounter with a black-and-white striped lobster and lots of tiny black-and-yellow fish.\n* On the 5th day of kindness, a vase of flowers appeared at the breakfast table as a surprise gift to friends.\n* On the 6th day of kindness, a group of youngsters whom I had never met allowed me to sit on the beach with them watching the sunset. Then they said “Thank you. You have honoured us.”\n* On the 7th day of kindness, the sky gifted me a bunch of fluffy silver afternoon clouds that looked like a forest out of the plane window.\n* On the 8th day of kindness, Vicky said to me: “Kindness is giving back.”; sparkling moments in her life: becoming a mother and then adopting an orphaned teenager; she would like to have the talent of hiking; imparting knowledge is what makes a better life.\n* On the 9th day of kindness, André said to me: “Kindness makes you you,” and “If you make small changes, it can become big changes.”  Paulette said: “I’ve seen what it’s like to live that life where you have nothing; I don’t have the heart to see someone else go through that.” She would come back to life as herself; his motto is “never give up ever.”\n* On the 10th day of kindness, I paid for parking for a stranger who didn’t have change for the parking meter.\n* On the 11th day of kindness, our HR team gifted me (and many others) a beautiful end-of-year email titled “Joy and kindness.”\n* On the 12th day of kindness, a good friend sent me an immensely sweet and caring voice note\n* On the 13th day of kindness, I didn’t write it down and my memory fails me.\n* On the 14th day of kindness, same again.\n* On the 15th day of kindness, I practiced the value of listening to a teammate who needed to talk.\n* On the 16th day of kindness, reflected on the kindness of the friend who connected me to so many kindness heroes.\n* On the 17th day of kindness, I stopped by the roadside to get roses for a friend suffering from covid.\n\nAnd yes, it’s 17 days instead of 7. Which just goes to show we always have more kindness than we think and it always goes much further than we think!\"\n\n\n**\nFanny Damiette\nBrand Strategist\nParis, France\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Sometimes making space for someone's pain, feelings, discomfort or joy is the kindest thing one can do. It's about the other one (except when it's kindness for self).\"\n\nStart with the smallest step, even if it means kindness towards yourself.\n\nFrom the Journey of Souls by Michael Newton\n\"Life is offered as a means of self-expression, only giving us what we seek when we listen to the heart. The highest forms of this expression are acts of kindness.”\n\n\n\n** Mathew Bernhardt\nStrategy & Ops\nNew York City, US\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* I gave a blanket to someone who was cold on the plane.\n* I was able to share quality time with a good friend.\n* I was able to help people do their job even if they did not need it.\n\n\"Small actions go a long way. One doesn't need to wait for a great big deed to be kind.\n\n\n**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** François Ausseill\nJournalist\nNairobi, Kenya\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\"As I'm preparing to move back to France, I've been giving away a lot of things I can't take with me.

We all played games outside after, throwing the frisbee and playing on my balance board.\n* I felt a sense of love and warmth after work. To assist briefly bridging gaps in schooling and see smiling faces so joyous with laughter was incredible. It has made me rethink however reminded me how simple of it is to do things in our community.\n* The hoodies power feels like it follows me everywhere. It's like a halo for goodness.\n\nAnita\n* I observed acts of kindness from others. e.g. volunteered with the surf lifesaving parol in Sydney during the week of Christmas\n* There is a continuum of kindness from the simple and one off (like letting someone go ahead of the queue) through to the repeated and high risk(like SES and Surf Savers)\n* Kindness is everywhere - we just need to notice it, appreciate and practice it.\n\nJade\n* Some beautiful moments - tangible and non-tangible. Supported an Iraqi family with reading, patience with myself and partner, supporting local business, visited any grandparents and support kindness to myself through time.\n* It's made me more aware of moments of kindness. Kindness is not simply doing but its moment of being. Kindness is for the self, kindness is for your community. People are open to accept kindness, we need to give it.\n* Be present with the time, be aware of the time and simply enjoy.\n\nParul\n* Everyday (and every moment) was kind and magic. From connecting with old and new friends, caring for the planet and looking after myself, I was in 'FLOW' all week.\n* I realise, kindness is not what I do, it is Who I AM... No matter what life throws at me, I can ALWAYS (and I mean always) respond with kindness. Thank you hoodie for changing my life\n* Treat the week ahead as the last (or first) of your life.

A lot of the foundations of our systems design knowledge comes from human beings today and yesterday who claim to hold all the intelligence and exclude many others. Meanwhile, our systems are breaking because we have excluded intelligence from many human beings who were systemically removed from inside the castle walls and we also removed our relations with 7 million other species.\n\nNow the planet is screaming out to us? And our challenge is to move our economics.\n\nSounds like a big deal?\n\nYeah, but economics is ours.\n\nIt’s shifted by shifting our attention, our intention and a little of our $$, and that can move how the river runs.\n\nOur problem:\n\nWe don’t have intelligent relationships with nature in the mainstream.\n\nOur solution:\n\nOur Indigenous people and systems do - we value nature, we have intelligent relations with nature, the knowledge is stored in nature, so we don’t need to extract it because it’s our libraries, the other species are in relation with us, mapped from the beginning to now and beyond.\n\nSo how do we shift? How do we fuse the systems?\n\nWell for starters we had to move yesterday - let’s get that cleared. Sitting on our hands, navel gazing and ignoring the disastrous global hurt we are all contributing to is not going to solve it,  the water will keep rising. So the question is, you wanna ignore it, or you wanna get to work?\n\nHow can we do it?\n\nWe can return to relations with the water, as one example.\n\nWe have created a 10-year research project for Organisations around the world to prove the intelligence of nature and activate a pathway for nature IP and, in doing so, open some of the 900B nature positive markets yet to be unlocked.\n\nOur first bridge we are shaping is a rerouting of relations in Sydney.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n20 Organisations get the chance to nominate 10 people to have an old/new learning and development experience - to go underwater, to relate to the crayweed, to open the orientation with Indigenous story and ceremony and to take that intelligence back to work and into their lives.\n\nOn the last Friday of every month, we go to one of the 20+ beaches that Operation Crayweed (https://www.operationcrayweed.com/) is helping reforest, and we have a sunrise ceremony, science, and snorkelling experience with the crayweed.\n\nIt’s a 10-year opportunity and to be a shareholder in the experience. It’s $5K per year - and I’ve been around some of the biggest and smallest Organisation leaders in the world, $5K is often blown over a lunch, 500 bucks is thrown at a L&D experience which  isn’t gonna change the game, and for the bigger players 50K is often bundled into playgrounds that don’t shift how we live and work - it’s charitable and transactional.\n\nSo what’s the impact of this thing?\n\nWe start in Sydney and this happens:\n1. 20 Organisations with up to 100 different people have leadership experiences that we track the impact of and start to be able to measure the increase in intelligence of the people involved - we then start to open a pipe up to say - hey what IP does the crayweed get for this? And create a financial pathway back to the crayweed for IP of ideas that have come from their relations\n2. Oh yeah…AIME takes $0 from this, does the right thing and routes the full 1M from the 20 shareholders to Operation Crayweed to reforest 22 beaches across Sydney’s Coastline, bringing homes back for 100s of microfauna, abalone, crayfish, all while sucking carbon out of the atmosphere.\n\nWhat’s this do globally?\n3. Gets nature IP onto the balance sheet and provide a passageway to unlock the 900B nature positive marketplace we HAVE to unlock as a species, otherwise none of that money we are hoarding will be worth anything cos it’ll be see ya later humans\n4. Provides a case study for every Organisation to return to the water and key groups involved in reforestation / restoration / regeneration to have a business model to move $$ and attention and intention to activate custodial economies\n\nI heard that there’s some people in Sydney that value our beaches.\n\nI’ve heard there’s some Australians that believe we can help lead the world.\n\nI’ve heard there’s some leaders out there that want to stand up and find the path forward and not bury our heads.\n\nI’ve heard there’s some leaders that want to be the smartest in the world and realise the intelligence is always outside the margins.\n\nI’ve heard there’s some cats that wanna crack the nature positive market. And I’ve heard that we are a good species, a species that cares, that knows nature birthed us, that no ideas are ours, and that it’s cool to be kind.\n\nLet’s knock this on the head - it’s Sea The Weed’s first birthday in October (https://www.aimementoring.com/sea-the-weed) - let’s lock our 20 shareholders by then.\n\nI’m standing on the bridge between yesterday and tomorrow with my hand to you - grab it and lets go.\n\nSydney Organisations reply to this email.

      "Copy": "*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|*\n\nView this email in your browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\nWelcome to a letter from Jack MB, AIME CEO and Founder on this Giving Tuesday\n\nFriends,\n\nThis is a big email...\n\n...after 18 years of hanging out with AIME, I'm excited to share the feeling we have as we gear up for the most important 10 years of our work.\n\nThis is the chance to release a global alternative to social networks at scale, built on the 18 years of this relational network, a relational economy and nation.\n\nIMAGI-NATION will center the intelligence from outside the margins at the front of the systemic design process for the next century and beyond.\n\nWe are moving the world to value intelligence and systems thinking from Indigenous systems thinkers and those that have been shut out by the castles, models and patterns we’ve inherited.\n\nWe’ve also thought about our legacy as an organisation, about what we can leave behind, to help provide a platform for unlikely connections at scale, a network for the centering of wisdom and intelligence from outside the margins, and then showcase the value of this relational economic way, this riteway of flow.\n\nAnd then we are going to bounce off the table, we have just approved at board level AIME’s intentional death 10 years from now, to open up this world of economic, social, network wealth and health, and then do what mentors do, pass it on.\n\nWe believe we are all in relation, that our organisations in part are so unhealthy because they work in isolation, they are not in relation, they are not working to intentional death to then pass on the knowledge and intelligence to other organisations to increase the overall network health.\n\nIn order to accelerate this work, to do more in 10 years than we may have in 50, we are going all in for the next 10 years. Today we share with you our plan to take $$ out of the equation, to raise $100M to fund our network for the next 10 years, and once it’s raised we won’t be taking another $$. We’ll be connecting the wealth with the intelligence and be the platform and broker between the brilliance we know is out there and the financial capital that has yet to value that marginal intelligence at the front of the systems design process.\n\nOnce we raise the $100M we'll be going fully relational to focus on Hoodie Economics, relational economics, exchanges of time, knowledge and opportunities, and we'll create the platform to see huge relational wealth exchanged at scale.\n\nI’ve written a book on Hoodie Economics which comes out next year and over the next 6 months we’ll share some of the philosophy in our thinking and where we are heading.\n\nAs we look ahead we are excited to be going full throttle at capacity building, creating tools and systemic change.\n\nSome of our 10-year systemic projects which we can announce today that we’ll be working on in IMAGI-NATION include:\n\n1) 1 billion mentors trained via Go1 (https://www.go1.com/) + 5000 organisations activated as JOY Corps training their staff and building their own mentoring bridges to high schools\n\n2) Nature fund outta NYC with Ethic (https://www.ethic.com/) and Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs (https://ikslab.deakin.edu.au/) to centre nature as a financial tool with Indigenous systems thinking at the front of the design process\n\n3) Centering Imagination and planetism in every classroom with LearningPlanet (http://www.learningplanet.com/#/) to see the intelligence of our young people activated with their imaginative best to be able to inherit life on the earth and shape a healthier model for humanity to connect and live in synergy with our planet and all of its inhabitants.\n\n4) We are in conversation with Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/) about training every teacher in the world to be a mentor\n\n5) Kindness economy project - HUMAN/KIND/\\\\/KIND\\HUMAN with music festivals around the world\n\nAnd there's plenty more emerging once IMAGI-NATION opens - think of IMAGI-NATION as MIT Media labs x 1000000.\n\nToday we can also announce some of the partners that will work towards securing the $100M financial capital. Inequity is 7 billion people and I couldn't see how the inequity faced by Indigenous people in Australia would change without shifting our global economies and where we source intelligence from and put our attention to. The team and I are really proud that we believe most of the $100M will be generated beyond Australia's borders, and our work with groups like Ethic (https://www.ethic.com/) and so many more centre a global economy for Indigenous systems thinkers.\n\nWe are hopeful this will be our last Australian federal government agreement and we'll leave behind a national economy around mentoring and unlikely connections, around systemic patterns, imagination, hope and action, and we'll do the same on a global scale when we unlock for humanity the largest source of intelligence on planet earth, intelligence from outside the margins.\n\nWe are excited to announce our partners as part of Giving Tuesday globally and we are hopeful of raising $100M before the end of the year. Here's our first round of partner announcements:\n\n1. $10M joint-raise with Jane Goodall Institute (https://janegoodall.org/) , with $8M for AIME’s work\n\n2. $10M joint-raise with LearningPlanet (http://www.learningplanet.com/#/) , with $5M each for our 2 organisations\n\n\n** How about we end with a bit of colour?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have finished this email with two deeper texts to explain the next 10 years:\n\n1. 100 Pages in colour (https://investorpage.softr.app/)\n\n2. 20+ pages in black and white (https://docs.google.com/document/d/14q0udHeF2eNSLfBmyfyRsVwohNJ5XR2sQndqq0jCuI0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBoth documents dig into the detail and philosophy. There is a world to be changed. 10 years, let’s go all in, we are very excited to have the chance to move where we as a species place value with our time, knowledge and opportunities and remember our custodial ways to activate a healthier, kinder, more joyful, fairer world.\n\nSending you the best of vibes.\n\nJack MB\n\nAIME CEO and Founder\n\n============================================================\nCopyright © *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*, All rights reserved.\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|* *|LIST:DESCRIPTION|*\n\nOur mailing address is:\n*|LIST_ADDRESS|* *|END:IF|*\n\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can\n** update your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*)\nor ** unsubscribe from this list (*|UNSUB|*)\n.\n\n*|IF:REWARDS|* *|REWARDS_TEXT|* *|END:IF|*"

From the first moment we met I instantly felt comfortable with them and better about myself. They are not only kind to me and their family but everyone they know they have been kind to strangers waiting at bus stop and kids they have mentored in after school programs. I wish more people were as kind as Sean.\n\nPassion and practice in education, art, indigenous communities and culture… need I say more about this amazing person that serves our youth.\n\nSitara goes out of her way to help anyone she crosses paths with. She always has time and energy to give and does so with a smile on her face. She is the type of person if you mention you are forgot to get your wife a gift for her birthday in a casual conversation, you will have a list of options in your inbox that hour. Her kindness is the type that can go unnoticed but the kindness we all need.\n\nJess considers others at every point of every thought process/decision she makes. She only makes her decisions when she knows it will positively influence others. A key example is how she runs Dance Chance - a weekly dance group for those with intellectual disability. In addition to this, how she spends her time/how she makes her income considering how her mind can influence others to act authentically and kindly.\n\nTerrance always gives his time freely to assist not for profit community focused organisations. His efforts have assisted these organisations in their growth and he is always incredibly kind, accomadating and hard working.A wonderful addition to the collective gathering. He has been put forth due to his ability to assist charitable causes professionally and his person values on kindness.\n\n———\n\nPeace out\n\nAIME\n\nView this email in your browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n\nGot a question?\nEmail Ben (mailto:bk@aimementoring.com)\nLogo\n\nCopyright © *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*, All rights reserved.\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|* *|LIST:DESCRIPTION|*\n\nOur mailing address is:\n*|LIST_ADDRESS|* *|END:IF|*\n\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe from this list (*|UNSUB|*) .\n\n*|IF:REWARDS|* *|REWARDS_TEXT|* *|END:IF|*"

Below the waterline lies a deeper system of thinking and relating that stretches back 60,000+ years.\n\nWe're at a turning point. Our social networks divide us, nature signals distress, and our connections to each other grow weaker. What's visible above the water is fragmenting.\n\nBut beneath the surface, there's hope. Indigenous knowledge - the longest-running intelligence system on Earth - holds the patterns we need to heal our relations with each other and with nature. These are the deep currents that have sustained human life for millennia.\n\nToday, we're inviting you to dive beneath the surface with us. To see how Indigenous thinking and modern tools can weave together.

In doing so we celebrated the relations and connections created during the founding year of IMAGI-NATION {University} and took a deep dive into the inspiration behind the 6 finalists' thesis (try saying that 3 times fast) on the topics of imagination, building bridges, organising change, flipping the script, hoodie economics and mentoring.

I reside in Athlone, Gweru, Zimbabwe.\n\nMy main goals in life are to create initiatives and lead projects that will help to boost my economy, help my environment as well as help the needy, less-privileged than me and vulnerable.\n\nI have a strong affinity for art, mainly calligraphy and origami, research, writing and languages.\n\nI can speak three languages very well (English, Shona and Ndebele) and I can speak two languages intermediately (Korean-Hanguel and French) which I am teaching myself with the few resources that I have.\n\nI want to be part of the people who can make a change in the world and make it a better place through doing things I love.\n\nWhatever I do, I do it not from the left or the right but from the seed of my heart.\n\nI love writing and drawing because each piece tells a different unique story that communicates a strong message to anyone who is reading or studying it.

Born from a vision to alleviate educational inequities in Australia. The methodology focused on creating a supportive environment where Indigenous students could thrive. The program provided structured mentoring, tutoring, and leadership development activities. This holistic approach addressed both academic and personal development, ensuring that students had the confidence and skills to pursue further education and employment opportunities. In 2016, AIME supported 6686 mentees, 2255 mentors, 340 partner schools and 18 University partners.\n\n“After two years of running AIME I can honestly say that there is something in this Program that can make genuine change for young Indigenous people. I'm not afraid to say that and am happy to embrace the fact that this Program is destined to grow and with more hard work it is destined to succeed.”\n\nJack Manning Bancroft, AIME Founder and CEO, 2012\n\nThe front page of an AIME newsletter 2012\n\n\n** Global Expansion: 2016-2018\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2016, the AIME Board approved a $500,000 investment from its reserves to launch a global expansion, aiming to connect Indigenous communities worldwide with mentors and resources. This initiative sought to address global inequities by bringing Indigenous knowledge to the forefront of global problem-solving. Over the next two years, AIME's efforts culminated in the establishment of a robust global network, supported by 15 organisations and 10 universities, with their leaders endorsing AIME's mission through an open letter. The program had proven its efficacy in Australia, creating a significant impact valued at $1.17 billion in net direct economic benefits​​ (KPMG Economic Evaluation (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-SONWKp3qoOErWAoRg_ZljXRMEhsRDbJ/view?usp=sharing) ).\nhttps://youtu.be/K_ZMi1sobOc?si=dCy9WBDQE2NGYVOv\n* Global Letter of support (https://drive.google.com/file/d/10SF76kSZ7B41P7Q11sOxxhMs7N9_R7UY/view?usp=sharing)\n* 7 Down (https://youtu.be/K_ZMi1sobOc?si=dCy9WBDQE2NGYVOv)\n\n\n** Transformative Years: 2018-2019\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2018, KPMG conducted an economic evaluation of AIME's programs, underscoring their positive impact. The following year, Harvard Business School wrote \"AIME High: A Social Entrepreneurs Moonshot\". This period marked a shift to a volunteer-led model, making the program free for universities and schools, which led to a reduction in mentee numbers from 6,827 to 5,702. Despite this, AIME's vision to create a global stage for Indigenous youth remained strong, highlighted by the creation of the IMAGINATION DECLARATION at the Garma Festival. In 2019, AIME collaborated with 17 universities and 251 schools.\n\nThe Imagination Declaration - August 5 2019, 10:00am\n* 2018 - KPMG Economic Evaluation (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-SONWKp3qoOErWAoRg_ZljXRMEhsRDbJ/view?usp=sharing)\n* 2019 AIME High: A Social Entrepreneurs Moonshot, Harvard Business School, January (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AfQKr4WWgUWKceyuB2MnpYmVFsW7MdJx/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n** Adapting in Crisis: 2020\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2020, AIME launched IMAGI-NATION{TV}, a digital platform aimed at fostering educational impact globally. The COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges, but AIME swiftly transitioned to a digital delivery model, focusing on developing mentoring tools to extend its reach. In 2020, AIME supported 723 mentees and 44 mentors, while its resources were downloaded over 8,000 times by educators, indirectly impacting up to 275,709 students. The IMAGI-NATION{TV} platform recorded over 19,066 views, demonstrating the program's resilience and adaptability​​​​.\n* 2021- IMAGI-NATION{TV} - Educational Impact Report (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-WGaxufqCO6L4BDEkVP6CF_IGQsnvz5s/view?usp=sharing)\n* IMAGI-NATION{TV} highlights (https://vimeo.com/aimementoring/intvsizzle?share=copy)\n\n\n** Building a Digital Nation: 2021-2022\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Australian government further supported AIME's global vision with a $500,000 investment announced by the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt. This funding was pivotal in developing AIME's global relational network, connecting Indigenous communities with mentors worldwide. By the end of 2021, AIME's IMAGI-NATION project was set to create a virtual nation led by Indigenous systems knowledge, aiming to unite diverse networks to tackle global challenges​​​​.\n\n“The work AIME does mentoring young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is invaluable. We’re proud to be investing $500,000 to support the development of their global relational network, to connect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with mentors around the world.\nThis is an exciting global vision and will create a range of new opportunities for our young people\"\n\nHon Ken Wyatt AM, MP\n\nMinister for Indigenous Australians\n* IMAGI-NATION{Uni} launch Oct 2021 (https://mailchi.mp/aimementoring.com/imagi-nation-1376721)\n* Partnership announcement June 2023 - ethic, Guardians, Learning Planet, Karmen, Jane Goodall (https://mailchi.mp/aimementoring.com/partnership-announcements?e=8bab1d3513)\n* Sneak peek for next week (https://aimelinks.softr.app/) ;)\n\n\n** AIME Achievements\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* 2013 - Ranked 26th in BRW’s Best Places to Work in Australia; the only non-profit organisation to make the list that year and the first ever Indigenous organisation to make the top 50.

It’s like the floodgate of imagination’s opened right up, and I tell ya what, I’m lovin’ it!\n\nPanga: Yeah, it was a great idea to push our first UNCx5 to January 31st, 2025 so that we can capture the energy of the visa holders coming through now.\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: True! We really are unlike any other stuffy, boring old visa office putting process before people… And before puppets! I’m proud of us!\n\nPanga: Me too!\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: So come on, give us the info on the visas that are still live on the website??\n\nPanga: You gotta check out the ads I just pinned on the Job Board.\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: Oh that’s right, of course, I’ll go now and check it out. Oh hold up, before I go, when do the applications close? I don’t wanna miss out mate…\n\nPanga: Applications close on December 2nd!\n\nScroll down to check out the job board with the visas that are still open for 2025!\n\n\n** THE JOB BOARD\n------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/visas/custodian-visas\n\nIMAGI-NATION’s Custodian Visa is a 12-month commitment designed for visionary leaders and changemakers. Limited to 100 participants, Custodians guide the networks of IMAGI-NATION, providing strategic mentorship, fostering collaboration, and aligning initiatives with the organisation’s mission of imagination, justice, and sustainability.\n\nKey responsibilities include mentoring emerging leaders, facilitating cross-sector partnerships, monitoring project impact, and representing IMAGI-NATION at global forums. Custodians benefit from leadership training, networking opportunities, and the chance to shape the organization’s future direction.\n\nIdeal candidates are proven community builders with expertise in systems thinking, social and environmental justice, and Indigenous knowledge systems. This program offers a unique platform to drive transformative global change.\n\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/visas/indigenous-knowledge-systems-labs\n\nJoin a 10-year research project to establish 1000 Land-Based Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs!\n\nBe part of a transformative journey to redefine humanity's relationship with the natural world. This project will activate 1000 decentralised, on-land labs guided by Indigenous custodians, unlocking the vital intelligence of nature.\n\nIKS Labs will bridge ancient Indigenous knowledge, natural systems, and modern structures like nation-states and economies, creating a new path for leaders to reshape how we value and sustain life on Earth. Let’s reimagine the future together!\n\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/visas/imagi-nation-presidents\n\nJoin a 10-year research project for 1000 youth to re-establish custodial economies worldwide!\n\nThe IMAGI-NATION Presidents VISA is for 12-30-year-olds who have been systemically pushed outside the margins. What we define as outside the margins is twofold, historically marginalised by societal design - e.g. Anyone that wasn’t inside the castle. And then, for young people born today, we acknowledge that even if you’re born into the castle, the climate change reality won’t discriminate. So it’s all young people that can move into this role.\n\nThe role of the IMAGI-NATION President is to re-establish custodial economies, which are nature-centred economies that prioritize the well-being of the natural world and its resources.\n\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/visas/joy-corps\n\nJoin a 10-year research project to reimagine your organisation with Joy Corps!\n\nJoy Corps is a groundbreaking initiative transforming how organisations operate by prioritising sustainability, creativity, and harmony with nature.\n\nBy embracing Joy Corps, your organisation will redefine success, align with nature, and contribute to a joyful, sustainable future. Let’s innovate together!\n\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/visas/imagi-labs-schools\n\nJoin a 10-Year research project  to transform education with IMAGI-NATION Labs!\n\nThis global initiative empowers schools, especially those with marginalised or Indigenous students, to shift from challenges to real-time solutions.\n\nCreate IMAGI-NATION Classrooms, collaborate with global organizations, and tackle humanity’s biggest challenges—today. By embedding imagination, custodianship, and mentoring into the curriculum, schools can achieve Imagination Lab accreditation, unlocking a global marketplace of opportunities.\n\nLet’s make education the catalyst for real-world change.\n\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/visas/systems-change-citizens\n\nJoin a 10-Year research project tackling the biggest design challenges of the next decade with IMAGI-NATION Labs!\n\nBe part of a decade-long research project tackling global design challenges across energy, food, fashion, forests, and more. This program is for systems thinkers ready to shift from isolated actions to integrated, relational approaches.\n\nVisa holders will map connections within complex systems, exploring when and how to act effectively in solving challenges. With modules on custodianship, mentoring, and imagination, participants will deepen their systems design skills, integrating these insights with their own work.\n\nThe journey concludes with an accredited project—an essay, film, or documentation—showcasing how this experience reshaped their network, approach, and impact.\n\nApply for a visa now (https://www.aimementoring.com/visa-office-1)\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: Those ads are great, Panga! I just ran into Professor Magic who signed up for a visa.\n\nPanga: It’s not just him, the Visa Office has been buzzing! Humans from all over the world want a visa for IMAGI-NATION. We’re talkin’ dreamers, doers, change makers...\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: Alrighty! C’mon me mate Panga, don’t hold out, tell me more about the visa holders we’re introducing today.\n\nPanga: Well, Rainbow Dream, they’ve answered the big question: Why IMAGI-NATION? Why now? Their answers will blow your socks off.\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: Wait, lemme guess. They reckon imagination’s just for dreamers?\n\nPanga: Quite the opposite! These humans are making it clear: imagination is the engine driving solutions, hope, and systems change.\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: I bloody love that! So, who are these people we’re talkin’ about? Do we get to meet ‘em?\n\nPanga: Absolutely. Scroll down to hear their stories. And trust me, it’s worth it!\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: Alright, enuf carrying on from us, get those fingers scrolling and check out the trailblazers below!\n\nPanga: Hold onto your socks!\n\nScroll down to meet the five incredible visa holders and hear their take on why IMAGI-NATION matters today more than ever!\n\n\n** CASE STUDIES\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLaurean Ntaate\n\nUganda, Custodian\n\nMy name’s Laurean and I am a designer in the Toolshed as well as a Co CEO at AIME. My main areas of focus are Imagination Classrooms (I active imagination in schools with Professor Dream), IMAGINE film and, recently, IMAGI Studios.\n\nWhy IMAGI-NATION? Why now?\n\nNow has always been the best time to imagine what can be. Imagination is never lost and this is why we are trying to awaken it through IMAGI-NATION, to let it roar and move the world onto a path it deserves, to be proud of a heritage that thrives in resilience , to inspire a future generation that will only have recorded stories our time. They look to us now and beg us to do what’s right for humanity so why not Now?\n\n₭inray Hub: An Indigenous R&D Vanguard for Indigenuity and Bio₭ulture Design\n\n₭inray Hub stands as a transformative force in reimagining sustainable futures through the lens of biokulture Indigenous sovereignty and innovation. Anchored in the ancestral territory of the Chichupamp Clan, ₭aya and ₭ichwa Nation, Ⱥpya Yala/South America, Chinchaʸzʊyʊ/Ecuador under the Ⱥndean/Rʊnæ Embassy Protocol, ₭inray Hub dualizes ancestral wisdom with pioneering research to advance biokultural integrity, collective self-determination, collective authority, and economic enfranchisement.\n\nAt the heart of ₭inray’s efforts are two synergistic initiatives: the Indigenuity Lab, an outward-facing platform that collaborates with Indigenous Nations to address food sovereignty, climate resilience, and biokulture innovation, and the Bio₭ulture Systems Lab, an internal-facing space that operationalizes Indigenous ontologies, cosmologies, axiologies, epistemologies, and agnotologies into frameworks like the ȺR-IRB (Ⱥndean/Rʊnæ Institutional Review Board in service of Indigenous Nations collective authority). These Bio₭ulture Design Frameworks provide rigorous project verification, fostering trust-based collaborations rooted in ȺR reciprocity approach, care, and accountability. Internally, Bio₭ulture Design establishes a semi-permeable membrane for fostering Indigenous collective authority, enabling communities to thrive as sovereign entities rather than orphaned populations in their ancestral homelands.\n\nBy harnessing methodologies such as “Zɨkh’i Systems Ⱥrc” (a relational transmittance for ȺR-CST as governed by pacħa-kʊtɨk/cyclical time-space-place, kamas’ka/life force, and kɨnray/fluid light path of […]) and “Ʋkhʊ Ɬɬapan” (a relational transmittance for ȺR-AI as a convergence of hidden and holistic knowledge dimensions), Kinray Hub complements cultural epistemologies into technological advancements, creating AI systems (₭ʊntʊr, Ⱥmarʊ̕, and Pʊma) and data protocols that prioritize relational accountability and data sovereignty. These innovations enable Indigenous-led breakthroughs in STEAM fields while safeguarding biocultural intellectual property rights and ȺR data economy.\n\nKinray Hub catalyzes regenerative systems thinking through its relational approach, fostering sovereignty as a living, layered practice. It exemplifies a profound biokulture vision where science, stewardship, and sovereignty converge, offering culturally resonant pathways for a regenerative, equitable future and human-nature agency.\n\nResearchers like Belén Moya (non-Indigenous), a kollab, said Kinray is a space that invites us to be critical of the activities we engage in, to question, and unlearn traditional ways of “doing science” through knowledge production, with Indigenous and rural communities not as mere objects of study, but as active participants. She exemplifies this ethos, building meaningful connections between academia and Indigenous societies.\n\nŇkwi Flores\n\nIndigenous Knowledge Systems Lab, Ecuador\n\nTaeg Twist\n\nImagination President, Australia\n\nTaeg Twist is a Birri Gubba Birriah and Ngāpuhi person from Waibene in the Zenadth Kes. As a dedicated Youth Hub Coordinator at Queensland Aboriginal Islander Health Council (QAIHC), Taeg spearheads initiatives to empower  indigenous youth, fostering community resilience and well-being. With a passion for amplifying Indigenous voices and advocating for equitable access to healthcare and resources, Taeg brings invaluable insight and commitment to the global stage.\n\nWhy IMAGI-NATION? Why now?\n\nImagination is the heartbeat of change—it allows us to dream beyond the constraints of the present and shape futures rooted in possibility. For Indigenous people, imagination has always been our strength. It’s how we’ve thrived, passing down stories, creating worlds, and innovating through our deep connection to land, spirit and community.\n\nIn a world yearning for new ways to heal and grow, now is the time to lean into imagination. It’s how we disrupt systems that were never built for us, rewriting narratives to centre inclusion, resilience and the infinite potential of humanity.\n\nImagination is the seed of liberation and empowerment. For young people, it’s our most powerful tool—because if we can imagine a better tomorrow, we have the power to create it today.\n\nWhy IMAGI-NATION? Why now?\n\nGreen Disability was born from the realization that climate action is incomplete without accessibility. We are living in a world where climate crises and disability issues intersect, yet the voices of persons with disabilities are often left out of climate discussions. This is where IMAGI-NATION becomes crucial. IMAGI-NATION isn't just a program—it's a movement, a collective of minds and souls, from the margins, ready to bring change. The radical, systems-based approach it promotes aligns with the very essence of what Green Disability aims to achieve.\n\nIn a world that is increasingly complex and interconnected, the need for collaboration is more important than ever. IMAGI-NATION’s focus on breaking boundaries, leveraging knowledge from across sectors, and embracing diverse ways of knowing is exactly what’s needed to address the environmental, social, and economic challenges facing marginalized communities, especially disabled people in the Global South.\n\nNow, more than ever, we need to think outside the box, to use imagination, empathy, and collaboration to rethink what inclusivity in climate action really means. Green Disability believes that the solutions to our world’s problems already exist in the margins, and with IMAGI-NATION’s unique model, we can tap into this collective power, fuelling new ideas and creating solutions that are not just innovative but transformative.\n\nThe time is now. The urgency is real!\n\nPuneet Singhal\n\nSystems Change Citizen, India\n\nSita Cisse\n\nImagination Labs, Guinea\n\nSita is an aspiring educational entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of Mariama English and Computer Academy (MECA). MECA is their vision to provide high-quality education in English language proficiency and basic computer skills to underserved students in the remote rural regions of Guinea.\n\nTheir long-term goal is to establish MECA INTERNATIONAL, which will serve as both a preparatory institute and a gateway to world-class online higher education platforms, such as the University of the People, FutureLearn, and the UK Open University. Through this endeavour, they aim to empower underprivileged Guinean students with the tools and education needed to thrive in the global landscape.\n\nWhy Imagination? Why now?\n\nIMAGI-NATION aims at making the world a fairer, safer, and better place to live for everybody who is living in this modern world of the Information Technology (IT) era in which we are now living on earth. So, it is high time for everybody on earth to join forces with IMAGI-NATION to change our beautiful world for all and sundry on earth, regardless of their geographical location. Thus, I want to join forces with IMAGI-NATION in the mission of a global revolutionary change now.\nApply for a visa now (https://www.aimementoring.com/visa-office-1)\n\nPanga: What an unlikely group of visa applicants we’ve met so far.

Where ya been, ya little jet-setter?\n\nDaphne: The Systems Change residency!\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: Crikey! That sounds bloody fancy. Spill the beans, mate—how’d it go?\n\nDaphne: We started with sunrise ceremonies, grounding ourselves in land and culture, and then dove into deep work. The residents—visionaries like Rohani from Detroit, who’s reimagining food systems with Indigenous wisdom, and Thomas, building heliogenic societies with solar-powered solutions—brought their worlds into the studio. We paired their ideas with the expertise of others like Sarue, redefining mentorship, and Celeste, Shyaka and Matt, who are turning waste into energy.\n\nPanga: Wow, sounds like a brainy bunch. Did you create anything together?\n\nDaphne: We crafted tools—hoodie frames, podcasts, green-screen stories—all to carry this knowledge forward. Then, sitting in circles with Indigenous knowledge holders, we connected through hands and stories, weaving imagination into everything we touched.\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: Hoodie frames? Podcasts? Fair dinkum! You lot don’t mess around. What happens to all that knowledge now?\n\nDaphne: It goes to the network. That’s where the tools go now, Professor Rainbow Dream. They’ll find their way into unlikely hands, sparking relationships, and resetting patterns of thought. My origin isn’t just a place—it’s this process, this custodianship, this endless flow of knowledge passing from one to the next. That’s where I come from.\n\nPanga: Daph, that’s next-level!\n\nProfessor Rainbow Dream: I can’t wait to meet our next round of residents.\n\nDaphne: Applications are still open!

The AIME team with Uncle Noel and Aunty Trish planting two Proteas for Vhutali Nelwamondo.\n\nVhutali with Professor Song\n\nOctober, 2024 during the AIME Sydney to Melbourne Big Story Tour\n\nToday would have been Vhutali’s birthday.\n\nWe miss him deeply. And we carry him forward.\n\nAs part of our commitment to honour his life and legacy, AIME will share an annual update on the work in Africa on this day — every year for the next seven years. These special birthday editions will track the momentum sparked by Vhutali’s vision, love, and leadership.\n\nVhutali, in his element — rocking his AIME hoodie and lighting up the world with that unmistakable smile. A bridge-builder, a dream-carrier, a forever part of our story.\n\n“In a time when nations close their borders, when race is used to divide and conquer, and when we risk losing the feeling that connects us — we want to thank you.\n\nThank you for the support and love you've shown for Vhutali and his family in South Africa — for someone many of you may never have met in person, but felt through the shared human threads of feeling and compassion.\n\nThrough your effort to imagine beyond your screens, you found the heart that unites us. The kindness that makes us human. The courage that keeps building bridges, even in grief.\n\nWe want to round out this chapter through sharing what has been made possible through your support after Vhutali’s devastating and untimely passing.\n\n1. Together, your generosity has carried Vhutali’s family — through the weight of farewell and into the work of continuing his legacy.\n2. The search for Vhutali’s successors is now complete. We’re proud to share that a member of his family, Ndamulelo Nelwamondo (also known as Innocent), has stepped forward. We have also welcomed Mellon Ncube into the team.”\n\n“I just want to give some advice… to people around the globe:\n\nLet’s be kind to one another.”\n\nNdamulelo Nelwamondo (also known as Innocent)\n\nInnocent Nelwamondo: I decided to take a picture after reading IMAGI-NATION book by the Bancrofts. “Welcome to IMAGI-NATION—no passports required”. I LOVE the book🤩\n\nWords from Innocent: Continuing the Legacy\n\n“Thanks, Jack and AIME — I’m excited to be continuing where my brother left off.\nMy journey with tutoring and mentoring began in 2015 while I was studying Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Venda. I mentored students, offered career guidance in rural high schools, and even started maths tutorials that spread to surrounding villages.\n\nIn 2017, I paused my Honours studies for an internship in ecological data — and during that time, Vhutali told me about a chance to bring an Australian programme to South Africa. It was about bridging the gap between high school and university. I told him to follow his heart, and promised to support him.\n\nI was the first person to wear the AIME black-and-white T-shirt in South Africa — maybe even the first mentor to recruit himself! That shirt has meant a lot to me.\n\nSince then, I’ve become a programme manager at the University of Venda, where we’re now helping rural Grade 12 learners build digital literacy skills with a focus on data science. From 2022 to now, I’ve helped raise over R4.5 million for this work, reaching more than 400 learners.\n\nI have my Master’s in Data Science, and I’m passionate about building bridges through learning. This intro probably needs a podcast, but for now — I’m honoured to continue Vhutali’s mission.”\n\n— Innocent Nelwamondo\n\nMellon Ncube, ready to step into the next phase of her AIME journey\n\nWords from Mellon: A Full-Circle Moment\n\n\"My AIME journey began in the most unforgettable way, when two incredible mentors flew all the way from Australia to the University of Pretoria. I still remember the energy in the room — the spark of something different, something daring, and something that sounded so promising for the future of a Black student from Vosloorus at the University of Pretoria. That’s when I first learned about the powerful, world-shifting work AIME was doing, and I knew I had to be part of it. I was already dreaming about being on a flight to Australia, joining heads with like-minded leaders, draped in AIME’s colourful apparel, sitting on the shore watching the sun set.\n\nI started working as a mentor under the phenomenal leadership of Vhutali, and soon after, proudly became a Hooded Scholar. It was through those moments of mentoring, imagining, and connecting that I began to understand the true power of what AIME stands for: radical inclusion, wild imagination, and building a world where no kid is left behind.\n\nNow, being back in this space — working with my community at the University of Pretoria — feels like a beautiful full-circle moment. I’m excited to continue Vhutali’s powerful legacy, to reignite the fire of possibility on campus, and to grow this movement through joy, creativity, and deep, meaningful connections. We are here to flip the script — and I am all in for the ride!\"\n\n— Mellon Ncube\n\nVhutali Nelwamondo and local students, n.d.\n\n“We end with a rallying call — from Vhutali, from Innocent, and from all those who believe in building a more connected world:\n\nStand tall in the face of oppression.\nLove harder.\nBe more kind.\nGive it away to keep it.\"\n\nWith love and deep respect,\nJack Manning Bancroft and The AIME Team”\n\nView email in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|**|LIST_ADDRESSLINE_TEXT|**|END:IF|*\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe (*|UNSUB|*)"

We need to shift the system, side by side, the dollars have to move to systems change.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nVisit the Partnering page (https://www.aimementoring.com/partnerships-new)\n\nSo we stand together, the AIME Team, and reach out to you with this scorecard.\n\n2 years ago, almost to the day, we stood on a stage saying we want to raise $100m to move it from transactional relations to systemic repairing, from nature excluded to nature centred, from Indigenous knowledge excluded to being at the start of the design queue.\n\n2 years into the 100M raise we have raised $0 into the fund.\n\nWe've socialised the plan, with deep embassy across the earth and at home in Australia. There is no market for systems change. We are helping lead it. There is hardly a market for Indigenous knowledge systems labs, we want to help break it open. There is no market for nature centred economies - we want to help breakthrough.\n\nFor usall.\n\nWe've survived the last few years on project funding, and ticking over what we can, and being as lean as possible.\n\nWhen we launched the fund 2 years ago this hadn't happened:\nVisit the Partnering page (https://www.aimementoring.com/partnerships-new)\n\nSo we stand here with a callout to Billionaires (https://www.aimementoring.com/partnerships-new) , to people to introduce us to Billionaires, we are ready. 2 years ago was a vision. We get it we have had to do more of the translation work. We've done it. From manifesto to engineering, from dream to impact, from design to implementation. We've cut no corners on the knowledge work.\n\nAnd we stand here with no hype - $0 out of 100M into the fund. We stand with the same vision as 2 years ago. And we believe in human kind that we can move the way $$ work and in the next 3 years we can move this by:\n\n1. 5-10 Billionaires doing a one off 5-10M gift to IMAGI-NATION\n2. Systems Change Project funding via:\n\n* IMAGI-NATION Studios Design Labs for Governments, Corporations, big system collectives to solve big intractable challenges\n* Hoodie Economics relational investment into projects - from 10K to 500K (released today)\n\nLet's move the way the $$ work, towards nature, towards relations, towards knowledge, towards a healthier set of networks for usall.\n\nOur score 0 out of 100. I'd in the past be embarrassed to share this. No not anymore. You get 0 out of 100 when you are actually going for systemic change. So here we are, releasing control, sending out a message, we don't have the money, so we can't do much more but keep pressing for the biggest vision for change for usall, the rest, what can you do - know any Billionaires?\n\nSent with love, joy and hope\n\nJack Manning Bancroft\n\nAIME CEO and Founder on behalf of the AIME Team & IMAGI-NATION Custodians\nVisit the Partnering page (https://www.aimementoring.com/partnerships-new)\nhttps://vimeo.com/aimementoring/sunrise?share=copy\n\nWatch (https://vimeo.com/aimementoring/sunrise?share=copy) the Sunrise presentation and AIME troupe performance where we launch the fund and vision\nhttps://publishing.hardiegrant.com/en-au/books/hoodie-economics-by-jack-manning-bancroft/9781743799680\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1nXkjOC1dm-uDUrSJPoqZyj4ELZuRzxSZ/view\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/hoodie-economics\nhttps://vimeo.com/943199287?share=copy\nRead the Professors letter to humanity (https://www.aimementoring.com/letter-to-humanity)\n\nView in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n\nCopyright (C) *|CURRENT_YEAR|* *|LIST:COMPANY|*.

They follow the call of what could be, not what is. No fanfare. Just a deep yes to the work that matters.\n\nWhile systems stall and stall again, someone keeps building—connections, questions, bridges across continents and generations. Not for accolades. But because imagination demands action.\n\nThis is what it looks like when wisdom stays in motion\n\nNow back to your regular programming…\nhttps://vimeo.com/1050619213\n\nSound and vision collide—step into the constellation.\n\nDear Co-Dreamer,\n\nOver the past few weeks, we’ve asked you to IMAGINE what’s possible. To believe in a film seeded by hundreds of minds, co-created across cultures, countries, and generations. A film that tells a story for the margins and moves from them, toward a more connected future.\n\nAnd now, here we are. The final days of our crowdfunding campaign. And one thing is certain: We’re making this film. No matter what.\n\n⇨ Join the story (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/imagine-film--4?mc_cid=1fee220153&utm_campaign=1fee220153-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_08_26_11_15_COPY_02&utm_term=0_-45e1980432-&utm_medium=email&mc_eid=UNIQID&utm_source=AIME+Friends#/)\n\nThis week we introduce IMAGINE Film supporter Chris Bartlett — Emeritus Professor, Harvard Business School and Former Chair, AIME US Board. Chris is one of Harvard’s most widely published case study authors and a passionate advocate for Indigenous partnerships and youth mentoring through AIME and IMAGINE Film.\n\nToday Chris shares a little of his journey and why IMAGINE Film means so much to him.\n\nChris Bartlett, Photography anonymous waiter at a cafe ☕\n\n“When I first met Jack he told me something that has stayed with me. “When you shoot for the moon, even when you miss you end up among the stars.” Those words immediately struck me as capturing the soul of a visionary social entrepreneur.”\n\nChris sees IMAGINE Film as more than a film. IMAGINE is a blueprint for a new kind of world—one that decentralises power, elevates Indigenous knowledge, and builds global networks of support and imagination.\n\n“My life’s taken a few turns — from rowing in the King’s Cup, to consulting in post-independence Tanzania, to teaching at Harvard Business School. I’ve lived on four continents, held senior roles in three organizations, consulted to companies and governments, sat on a dozen corporate and nonprofit boards, and spent three decades in academia.\n\nIn all that time, I’ve met many successful and powerful people — but I’ve always been drawn to those with bold ideas and the courage to chase them. That’s the thread that runs through it all. And it’s what brought me back to Australia — to work alongside Indigenous leaders like Noel Pearson, building partnerships between corporations and communities. It was meaningful work, but over time I began to feel that we were treating symptoms. The deeper question was: how do we get to the root? How do we support the next generation?\n\nThat’s when I met Jack Manning Bancroft and got involved with AIME. His model — connecting university students with kids on the margins through mentorship — was simple, powerful, and full of potential. I wrote Harvard case studies about it, chaired AIME’s US board, and have stayed close as it’s grown.\n\nWhat AIME does is more than mentorship. It’s building networks that shift power. It’s about imagination — and dismantling the barriers that exclude. And when the pandemic hit, that spark of imagination became something even bigger.\n\nOne of the boldest ideas to come out of this movement is the IMAGINE Film. It’s more than a story — it’s a blueprint. A tool to gather, connect, and share the wisdom and creative fire that so often lives on the edges of society. A way of building the world not from the center out, but from the margins in.\n\nThis film is the message. It’s not top-down. It’s not corporate. It’s built by many hands — minds and hearts from the margins — and it reflects the imagination of different people and communities. The film embodies what we hope to replicate: a different way of creating, a different way of connecting. It shows — seductively and powerfully — what’s possible on a larger scale.\n\nPerhaps you’ve heard of Marshall McLuhan, whose famous aphorism was “the medium is the message.” He believed that the form of a medium can shape human perception as much as — if not more than — its content. McLuhan would be convinced that this film, even beyond its story, creates new patterns of interaction and vision. It is the message — in how it was made, and in what it invites us to become.\n\nToo often in Australia — and I’ve seen it in America too — we treat Indigenous people as a problem to fix or a population to manage. But what if we flipped that thinking? What if we recognised that here is a group whose knowledge, whose philosophy, whose approach to the land and to people, can teach the rest of us? You hear it every time there’s a bushfire — someone will say, “Back in the day, Indigenous people knew how to manage this land with back burning.” That wisdom is still there. We just have to listen. And we have to protect it, support it, and build with it — not over it.\n\nThat’s what this film invites us to do. To imagine a different world. And to start building it — together.”\n\n⇨ Become  Part of The Movement (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/imagine-film--4?mc_cid=1fee220153&utm_campaign=1fee220153-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_08_26_11_15_COPY_02&utm_term=0_-45e1980432-&utm_medium=email&mc_eid=UNIQID&utm_source=AIME+Friends#/)\n\nAnd Chris is not alone. With a growing community of collaborators, artists, educators and changemakers, IMAGINE is a radical act of creative resistance. It stands in defiance of the loneliness and illness bred by mainstream systems—and offers something profoundly human instead: connection, agency, and possibility.\n\nNow, at 82, Chris has stepped back from a few things. But not from supporting IMAGINE Film. It’s too important—not just for what it says, but for how it was made: with no blueprint, but belief. A leap into the void—being it, so others can see it, to be it.\n\nSo here’s to that leap—and to the people who make it.\n\n⇨ Leap into the void with us — so others can see it to be it!

However, we don't have to accept this loss. Drawing from the oldest living lab on Earth, with 60,000 years of custodial intelligence, we understand that our role is to work with the 20 billion animals and 70 million other species on this planet. By integrating their intelligence into our systemic designs and sharing this knowledge cyclically, we can rebuild our connection to nature.\n\nIn this episode of Hoodie Economics invite organisations to go beyond sustainability discussions and engage in systemic design, anchored in relation to the ocean and Sydney’s coastline. This is your chance to set a year-long strategy to align your organisation with nature, allowing the intelligence of this symbiotic relationship to inform your practices. The impact will be far richer than any charitable donation or sustainability report, fostering patterns that will enable humanity to thrive on Earth for centuries to come.\n\nLet's seize this opportunity to reforest a coastline together, creating a lasting legacy for our planet.\n\n\n** The Problem\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur oceans are in crisis. Overfishing, pollution, and climate change have led to the decline of marine biodiversity and the loss of vital seaweed forests. These underwater forests, once teeming with life, are now barren landscapes.\n\nSeaweed forests and their massive carbon capture capacity (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-07-16/seaweed-forests-massive-carbon-capture-capacity/102603342)\n\n\n** The Process\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSea the Weed was born via the Making of a Hoodie Podcast. Click here (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6jMneTyDvrsm3oxQmgTiSk?si=e202160bc5ed432a) to listen.\n\nWhen the pandemic landed in 2020, AIME flipped it’s whole world into a daily TV Show to bring mentors into kids lives - the program was called IMAGI-NATION{TV}. The TV Show became a lab of imagination, a place to think about big ideas, and after one of our AIME friends Damon Gameau, the creator of the film 2040, dropped into IMAGI-NATION{TV} we got to work on what we could do to help the climate and the world - and we looked to seaweed. Our founder made the Sea The Weed clip (https://vimeo.com/415349383) with his family & friend in lockdown, and AIME chased down a seaweed fabric to make one of the world’s first compostable seaweed hoodies. We found our friends at Pyratex in Spain and started the Making of A Hoodie Podcast with Damon, Regina from Pyratex.\n\nSea The Weed clip (https://vimeo.com/415349383)\n\nIMAGI-NATION{TV} (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjfNcXcq0TOQAt4vf7fCtuJQt1_OQWxQM&si=Ad605CwMtpiclxo1)\n\nDamon Gameau and Regenerators (https://theregenerators.org/)\n\nPYRATEX - Seacell fabric (https://www.pyratex.com/seacell)\n\n\n** The Solution\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat's where Operation Crayweed comes in. This innovative project aims to restore the crayweed forests along Sydney's coastline. Crayweed plays a crucial role in our marine ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of marine species and improving water quality.\n\nAccording to their calculations, for only AUD $1M  they could reforest all of Sydney’s harbour in over a decade. That’s where you come in.\n\n“The species we are regrowing on Sydney’s coastline is Crayweed, a species that supports crayfish, abalone and hundreds of other critters. We take healthy crayweed and plant it on deforested rocks, and then encourage the seaweed to reproduce and create ‘craybies’ that attach permanently to the reef, forming the basis of a new, self-sustaining population. The science is all there, we have the tools, knowledge and people-power, and now what we need is the means,”\n\nProfessor Adriana Verges\n\nOperation Crayweed lead\n\nOperation Crayweed (http://www.operationcrayweed.com/)\n\n\n** Understand the Impact\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeaweed forests are the lungs of our oceans. They capture carbon, helping to combat climate change. By restoring these forests, we're not just saving the ocean; we're saving our planet.\n\nOperation Crayweed (http://www.operationcrayweed.com/)\n\nThe Nature Conservancy announces unique Giant Kelp forest restoration partnership (https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/News/2023/July/The-Nature-Conservancy-announces-unique-Giant-Kelp-forest-restoration-partnership)\n\n\n** Join the Mission\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy becoming a shareholder of the ocean, you are making a transformative investment in the future of our planet.\n\nLeading you on this impactful journey are AIME’s dedicated Brendon Newton and Arthur Little. Having completed a systems change residency through AIME, they are equipped to guide you in understanding the profound impact and systemic outcomes of this initiative. Their passion and commitment are reflected in the inspiring stories they share below.\n\nSimply reply to this email to get started on the journey.\n\nArthur and Brendo explain the project (https://vimeo.com/869380545?share=copy)\n\nBrendo explains the science live (https://vimeo.com/aimementoring/seatheweedscience?share=copy)\n\n\n** Wear the Ocean\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a shareholder of the ocean, you won't just be contributing to the restoration of our marine ecosystems, but you'll also be wearing a part of it. These aren't just any hoodies, they are made with SeaCell technology produced in a closed loop, with no chemicals released as waste, exclusively from sustainable raw materials – wood and seaweed – using methods that save both energy and resources. The Icelandic seaweed is harvested from naturally occurring seaweed fields using careful, sustainable methods. Only the top part of the plant is removed, allowing the seaweed to continuing growing.\n\nPYRATEX - Seacell fabric (https://www.pyratex.com/seacell)\n\nMaking of a Hoodie - Sea the Weed (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6jMneTyDvrsm3oxQmgTiSk?si=9ebab2eca24b4456)\n\n\n** The systemic play\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis initiative to reforest Sydney’s coastline is more than just a local project; it's a catalyst for global systemic change, aligned with the principles of Hoodie Economics and the relational network ideals of IMAGI-NATION. By engaging in this reforestation effort, we are setting a precedent for the health of water systems worldwide.\n\nBy participating, you are not only helping to reforest Sydney’s coastline but also contributing to a larger movement towards global systemic change. Together, we can create a ripple effect that transforms our relationship with nature and ensures the health and sustainability of water systems around the world. Let’s build a relational economy that values our connection to nature and each other, fostering a sustainable and thriving planet for future generations.\n\nSo, let's fall in love with our oceans again. Let's restore them, protect them, and become shareholders of the ocean.\n\nJoin us in this mission. Become a shareholder of the ocean today.\n\nReply to this email or skip to the front of the cue by emailing Benjamin Knight at bk@aimementoring.com.\n\nAll the best\n\nThe AIME team\n\n\n** Additional reading\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

It’s nuanced, it takes time, it takes close observation. You don’t get the immediate hit. In this age of perpetual distraction and impatience, we’re all, ‘Where’s that waterfall? Where’s the green canyon? Where are the colourful tropical fish?’ A lot of the study of fungi now is molecular mycology. It’s incredible what this has revealed in terms of genes and the diversity of species and their histories, but it’s incredibly hard to convey that to the public by looking at a gene sequence in a laboratory. We need the molecular end, but we need to get people into the bush too, to care about it. All conservation needs care. We need to fall in love with it to have passion for it.”\n\nTom May, a senior mycologist at the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria\n\nReading the Mushroom at the End of the World (https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2023/june/cate-kennedy/reading-mushroom#mtr)\n\nGet more involved with AIME and IMAGI-NATION\n* Apply for a Visa (https://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office)\n* See the knowledge, thinking, strategy (https://www.aimementoring.com/knowledge-page)\n* Visit the Toolshed (https://www.aimementoring.com/toolshed/#list1)\n* Buy a Seaweed Hoodie (https://www.aimementoring.com/shop-details?recordId=rec4amg9jbOyRQPvC)\n* Buy Hoodie Economics - The Book (https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/hoodie-economics-by-jack-manning-bancroft/9781743799680)\n* Donate (https://www.aimementoring.com/donate/#custom-code1)\n\n\n** Stay tuned for…\n------------------------------------------------------------\nmailto:bk@aimementoring.com https://www.aimementoring.com/\n\nView email in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|**|LIST_ADDRESSLINE_TEXT|**|END:IF|*\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe (*|UNSUB|*)"

The depth and impact of this journey have been profound, and I find myself needing a bit more time to fully process and articulate its meaning.\n\nThis tour was about connecting the dots of imagination, mentorship, and custodianship across 2,000 kilometers of Australia's heartland. We've been weaving a tapestry of relations, bridging communities, and planting seeds of change.\n\nAs I work on capturing the full essence of our journey, I'm reminded of the complexity of the human brain:\n\nH01: One cubic millimeter of the human cerebral cortex.\n\nThe H01 dataset includes a wealth of data, over 50,000 cells and 130 million synaptic connections. The 3D world of the brain is browsable in Neuroglancer, all included, from large neurons down to single synapses.\n\n[See inserted image of H01 below}\n\nMy mind feels a bit like this right now - full of connections, synapses firing, trying to make sense of the profound experiences we've had. I want to ensure I do justice to the stories, the people, and the transformations we've witnessed.\n\nIn the meantime, I'd like to share a few insights from Professor Asterix, who summed up the essence of our journey:\n\n\"We didn’t come out here to really remote communities before because we hadn't built a network pipeline. We haven't thought about how we can leave behind infrastructure, a system, a network. But we have now. We've built IMAGI-NATION. We've built a country. We've reimagined the internet.\"\n\n\"We're not trying to convert people to one ideology, to one nation state. We're not making them sing an anthem, pledge an allegiance... We want free minds. We want to center nature. We want to pass on knowledge, not own it.\"\n\n\"I'm not a prop. I'm a gateway to a new country, a new place in the internet, a new network and we got eight years to work this out. So let's get to work.\"\n\nThank you Asterix for encapsulating the spirit of our journey and its connection to IMAGI-NATION.\n\nWe're building bridges, creating networks, and fostering imagination in ways that honour the long-standing wisdom of the communities we visit.\n\nI look forward to sharing a more comprehensive reflection soon. Thank you for your patience and continued support.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nBenjamin\n\nAIME Chronicler\n\nP.S. From Uluru to Darwin, we've chased the sun across the heart of Australia. But unlike these daily light shows, AIME's got a final curtain call set for 2032. We're not fading away though - we're going out with a bang, spreading imagination like wildfire! So let's make every sunset count, because our time to shine is NOW.

Looking at the ground, I felt like I was back home in Kalgoorlie, even though I'm living off country right now. It was like living my dream - I was looking at this book with a painting of Uluru with a rainbow over it, and then I turned around and there was a real rainbow appearing behind me. I felt like I was getting some kind of signals that the energy was good.\n\nLooking ahead, I think what we're doing now is carrying that spark of imagination. It opens up lanes of what's possible. Further down the line, I hope we can create a place for us mob, not only here at home but globally, to come together. We need to make a statement that we should be centred in design, that our knowledge needs to be valued when we talk about sustainability, regeneration, and conservation.\n\nThese things aren't really doing what people define them as. You have to be in it to really understand. It doesn't happen from ivory towers and policies and documents - all those super abstract things. It's here, in watching and being in place and connected to it, that the real design comes from. It's got to be beyond human because we're limited, but when we're connected, we can distribute that knowledge across us.\n\nThat way, our heads don't explode, which is great.\"\n\nStephani Beck\n\nVice Chancellor, IMAGI-NATION {University}\n\nAIME\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\n\nEven though we have 0 days to apply for your IMAGI-NATION Visas.

Today, we're taking you on a whimsical journey to the IMAGI-NATION Visa Office.\n\nBuckle up, because this isn't your average, bureaucratic experience!\n\nPicture this: A treehouse perched atop a giant sequoia, its branches adorned with twinkling fairy lights and colourful hoodies swaying in the breeze. This, my friends, is where the magic happens. Let's eavesdrop on a conversation between Professor Hope and a curious student named Zoe ...\n\nZoe\n\n(climbing the last few rungs of the rope ladder)\n\nPhew! Professor Hope, when you said your office was 'elevated', I didn't think you meant literally.\n\nProfessor Hope\n\n(chuckling)\n\nWelcome, Zoe! Nothing like a little climb to get those synapses firing, eh? Now, what brings you to our humble Visa Office?\"\n\nZoe\n\nWell, I've been hearing buzz about IMAGI-NATION Labs, and I'm wondering if my school should apply for a visa, but I'm not sure what it all means.\n\nProfessor Hope\n\n(eyes twinkling )\n\nAh, you've come to the right place! You see, these aren't your ordinary visas – they're passports to a world where imagination rules, and change is the only constant.\n\nZoe\n\n(looking around in awe)\n\nBut why hoodies, instead of stamps?\n\nProfessor Hope\n\nExcellent question! In our relational economy, hoodies are the threads that bind us. Each one tells a story of connections made, knowledge shared, and dreams realised. They're like wearable action plans!\n\nZoe\n\nThat sounds amazing! But what exactly would my school do as an IMAGI-NATION Lab?\n\nProfessor Hope\n\n(gesturing to a wall covered in vibrant sticky notes)\n\nYou'd be part of a global network solving the world's greatest challenges. Imagine turning your classroom into a think tank for climate solutions, or a laboratory for social justice. The possibilities are endless!\n\nZoe\n\n(eyes widening)\n\nWow! And we'd work with other schools around the world?\n\nProfessor Hope\n\nPrecisely! It's all about unlikely connections. You might collaborate with a school in Nairobi on a water conservation project, or team up with students in Tokyo to redesign urban spaces. It's a playground for your wildest ideas!\n\nZoe\n\nI'm sold! How do we apply?\n\nProfessor Hope\n\n(handing Zoe a digital tablet)\n\nRight here, my dear. But remember, this visa isn't just a piece of paper – or in our case, a digital hoodie token. It's a commitment to be part of something bigger than ourselves.\n\nZoe\n\n(scrolling through the application)\n\nIt says here that visa holders contribute to open-source IP benefiting nature. What does that mean?\n\nProfessor Hope\n\nIt means every brilliant idea, every solution you develop, becomes a gift to the world and to Mother Nature herself. We're not just changing the world – we're healing it!\n\nZoe\n\nThat's beautiful, Professor. I can't wait to tell my Principal!\n\nProfessor Hope\n\n(winking)\n\nThat's the spirit! And remember, in IMAGI-NATION, we don't just dream – we do. Now, are you ready for your first lesson in Hoodie Economics?\n\nAnd there you have it, folks! The IMAGI-NATION Visa Office is open and ready to stamp your passport to a brighter future. Whether you're a budding IMAGI-NATION President, a potential IMAGI-NATION Lab, or a future JOY Corps member, your adventure awaits!\n\nRemember:\n* Action visa applications close 31 AUG\n* Action visa onboarding is during SEPT\n* Action visas commence 1 OCT\n* 1st Action visa Club of Unlikely Connections 4 OCT\n\nDon't let this opportunity slip through your fingers, like sand through an hourglass.\n\nThe time to act is now! (https://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office)\n\nUntil next time, keep imagining, keep connecting, and keep changing the world – one hoodie at a time!\n\nImaginatively yours,\n\nThe Visa Office Team\n\nP.S. Stay tuned for our upcoming emails detailing each visa program. Together, we'll weave a tapestry of change that'll make even the most stoic bureaucrat crack a smile!\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/mentorclass/#dreams\n\n\n** …and don’t forget about MentorClass opportunities\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccreditation\n\n1000 Year Dream\n\nCustodian\n\nDigital\nApply (https://www.aimementoring.com/mentorclass/#dreams)\nApply (https://www.aimementoring.com/mentorclass/#dreams)\nApply (https://www.aimementoring.com/mentorclass/#dreams)\nExpress interest (https://www.aimementoring.com/mentorclass/#dreams)\nBook the 1000 Year Dream Embassy for your school (https://www.aimementoring.com/mentorclass/#dreams)\n\nView email in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|**|LIST_ADDRESSLINE_TEXT|**|END:IF|*\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe (*|UNSUB|*)"

We hope you connect with her story about AIME's Impact and what it takes to release it to the world!\n\nLet us know what you think. Just reply to this email...a human will be on the other end super keen to hear from you.\n\"Starting with my Grandmother, she taught me to embrace failure and be true to myself. Granddad actively sought people that disagreed with him because he thought he could learn a lot from them. You learn a lot from things that don't work out for you because they have something to teach. So from both of them, I learnt to embrace failure as part of learning.\"\n\nNdileka Mandela\nSocial activist and Head of rural upliftment organisation the Thembekile Mandela Foundation\nEldest grandchild of Nelson Mandela\n\nTaken fromIMAGI-NATION{TV} Episode 47  (https://youtu.be/M-GXLmsHhlE)\nStreamed live on May 27, 2020\n\n\n** How a sense of failure turns into a peaceful sunny afternoon\n------------------------------------------------------------\n(read the whole thing right here, no click-throughs, no distractions)\n\nPicture this: you’re sitting inside on a beautiful sunny afternoon. You look out through great big French windows onto green grass and handsome trees, leaves playing in the breeze, shadows dancing on the grass.\n\nYou make out the sound of a lawnmower somewhere, bees buzzing, birds, kids playing, people laughing. Perfect afternoon peace that makes your heart smile.\n\nYou decide to go outside and immerse yourself in this gift from nature. And then you discover there’s no way to get outside - there’s no door, the windows won’t open.\n\nYou search, you push, you try with all your might but nothing gives. There’s a great glass wall between you and the scene outside, you can’t reach it. Your disappointment grows into despair and then into a sense of being caught in some invisible thing you can’t fight against. You get frantic, and the more you struggle to find a way out, the further the beautiful scene outside seems to move away from you.\n\nThat’s what mental block feels like to me. And that’s where I’m sitting right now - in the depths of a two-month mental block, with the hope that writing these words will help free me.\n\nLet’s roll back a little to before I got stuck. Back in January, we started working on a very important and pretty exciting book at AIME that I got to write quite a lot of. I’ll tell you about it in the next issue of Failure Time and ask for your help in getting it done.\n\nNow I don’t have any trouble writing words. They usually just flow and I have trouble stopping them, more than anything. I also don’t have much trouble with getting ideas - those flow quite freely too.\n\nSo we start working on this book - Jack, Hannah, Adam, Ben, Kabir and me. We’re a bunch of different minds together, bringing our best thinking so we can write a great book. We’re imagining big things, hashing out ideas, reading, talking, bouncing questions around, being bold and BRAVE, trying things, wondering out loud, thinking hard, laughing, learning. And we’re writing - sometimes together, sometimes separately, sometimes simply by talking things through. Knowledge and energy are flowing in all directions. It’s an amazing experience.\n\nIt’s not easy, though. All this hard thinking and learning and questioning and creating, this process of coming to know something. I’m swinging from inspired to scared to excited to overwhelmed and a bunch of other feelings, because this is a big deal and I want to do my best.\n\nAnd that’s where it starts, that stuckness - I want so badly to do my best, that nothing I actually write seems good enough to me. I spend more time deleting than writing, starting out in one direction, abandoning that idea and heading another way. Hours at my desk add up to nothing. The words and ideas slowly dry up. March turns into April turns into May. Each new day, I’m convinced that with just a couple more hours I’ll have it done… Yet the days go by and I’m left with an unfinished book that I know I can finish but somehow can’t finish.\n\nWe’re so close to the end, some of the hardest work has been done, I know exactly how I want to bring the threads together. I can see it so clearly in my mind, like that afternoon scene through the window. But I can’t get to the end, I can’t get outside.\n\nIt’s called perfectionism, which is actually fear wearing fancy clothes. Fear of what, though? Of screwing up, not doing it well enough, not scoring top marks… Because that’s what it comes down to - feeling like a kid at school who won’t make the grade, who’ll get a bad mark, and then the teacher will frown and tell me off and it will feel like the end of the world. Remember those days, anyone?\n\nWriting these words makes me laugh. They look so tiny. What?! I’m a grown human who’s been working for many long years, after all. What is it that’s making me feel so much like a scared kid in school that I can’t finish an almost-finished book? And honestly, if Jack, Hannah, Adam, Ben, Kabir frown at me or even tell me off, will it really be the end of the world?\n\nI heard someone say last week that we are emotional beings who are occasionally rational. Basically, despite what we know and what we can see, despite how much of a grown human we are, what we feel takes over most of the time.\n\nAnd here’s the thing about emotions like fear - they get really big inside your head and crowd you out of your own mind. Reasoning doesn’t work. They make you forget you’ve done all this great work so far, that this is the way your mind works - different energies at different moments. To flow with the energy you have right now and it will take you where you need to get to. To be kind to yourself - without limit. And fear makes you feel small and helpless when you’re a whole grown human.\n\nWhat I’ve found is that naming the fear out loud shrinks it back into something that no longer looks like a monster (that naming out loud is the hardest thing, though!). So I tell Jack - I’m stuck, I’m scared. And you know what? It’s ok, the world doesn’t come to an end. Instead of frowning and telling me off, he says “Write about it for Failure Time and then just go ahead and put the book out there, it doesn’t have to be finished. Wherever it is, is where it needs to be.”\n\nSo that’s what I’ve done - written this, quit stressing about the book, embraced where I’m at, stopped struggling… and guess what? It’s been a beautiful sunny afternoon, I found my way outside to write this in a setting of green grass and handsome trees, leaves playing in the breeze, shadows dancing on the grass, bees buzzing, birds, kids playing, people laughing. Perfect afternoon peace that makes my heart smile.\n\nNext week I’m coming at you with a draft of the book we’re working on, with all the questions we can’t yet answer, and I’m going to ask for your help to finish it. Because we’re in it together, right?\n\nIn the meantime, write back and tell us how you work through the stuckness when it catches you. And what you learn from it. Thanks for reading these words.\n\nMuch love,\n\nIrmin\nHead of Impact\nAIME\n\n\n** Are you ready to fail?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCome fail with us and submit your failure time activity, experience or reflection to be added to our weekly mailouts.\nSubmit your failure >> (mailto:bk@aimementoring.com?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20submit%20a%20Failure%20Time%20piece%20of%20writing!)\n\n\n** Happy to help.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet us know if you have any questions.

They navigate the intangible, intuitively carving a path toward creations not yet brought into being. Today heralds a celebratory announcement: Simon and the Art Atrium team, who generously hosted us on a significant Monday, have not only ignited our 'Opening of Imagination' (https://aimementoring.com/) but have also launched a formidable tour to promote 'Hoodie Economics (https://aimementoring.com/hoodie-economics/) .'\n\nMoreover, they've courageously spearheaded our art fund with an inaugural bid of $30,000 (https://aimementoring.com/product/concrete-forest/) .\n\nIn the wake of pervasive global discord, on that particular Monday in Sydney, we congregated post-referendum—a period which, for many, marked an epoch of pain and a seeming regression of progress spanning decades. The shadow of strife extends far beyond, touching lives ravaged by the enduring conflicts in Israel and Palestine, amongst others. History's canvas is repeatedly stained by the tumult of war, yet it also relentlessly impels us towards the oasis of peace. In our search for joy, deep empathy, and understanding, we find the imperative to make room for collaboration, to be solution-focused, to unravel the Gordian knot of our shared challenges.”\nRead more (https://aimementoring.com/2023/11/03/a-reflection-from-jack-manning-bancroft-on-the-inaugural-bid-in-aimes-imagi-nation-art-fund/)\n\n\n** Meet Simon\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe inaugural bidder of $30,000 for Concrete Forest by Ah Xian (https://aimementoring.com/product/concrete-forest/) in AIME’s IMAGI-NATOIN Art Fund\n\nSimon Chan by Tony Costa. Oil on canvas. Archibald Prize finalist, 2017.\n\nSimon Chan is an individual of multifaceted talent and significant influence in the art community.\n\nAs the director of Art Atrium (https://artatrium.com.au/) in Sydney, which he founded in 2009, he brings a wealth of experience to the table, not only as a gallery director but also as a seasoned architect and an art collector with over three decades of passionate engagement in the field.\n\nSimon offered his Gallery, Art Atrium (https://artatrium.com.au/) , in Sydney to host AIME’s first Puzzle event to open the IMAGI-NATION Art Fund. (https://aimementoring.com/gallery/) He was kind enough to sit down for a chat with us to talk about his motivation to be involved.\n\nSimon on the value of art beyond commerce\n\n\"You don't do everything just because you can make money. Of course, we’ve got to survive. But at the same time, it's very good for your soul, for your spirit. A lot of art is actually a means for artists to express their opinion and thoughts in terms of political social issues as well. Sometimes the type of work artists do, may not be commercially popular among potential buyers. But, the work is significant in its own right in various ways, potentially both artistically as well as conceptually.\"\n\nOn the relationship between galleries and artists\n\n\"For me again, when you talk about relations, I value the relationship between me and my artists a lot more than sales. It’s a long-term relationship. I want them to support each other by coming to each other's openings and collaborating on works.\"\n\nWhy he made a bid for Concrete Forest\n\n“Ah Xian is one of those artists that is not represented by a gallery, I don't know how he does it. He basically just represents himself. He won't sell his work to anybody. He only sells work to people who are passionate collectors who are not buying his work and then offload it as soon as it goes up in value to make a profit. Concrete Forest is his message to the world that humans are destroying the environment. This is not a limited edition, it's a one-off. So I thought, well, I'll be the first off the mark. Hopefully that sets a good example for others to follow. And even if someone outbids me, that would be great. And I can buy something else.”\n\nConcrete Forest (https://aimementoring.com/product/concrete-forest/) - a series of 36 concrete busts by Ah Xian that won the last Clemenger Prize in 2009, a prestigious invitation-only art prize held at the National Gallery of Victoria. Working with materials as diverse as cloisonné, porcelain, concrete, fibreglass, bronze and, most recently, latex, the Chinese-Australian artist has won major sculpture prizes and much acclaim in Australia. The work is presented as 36 single photos in a frame as well as 1 frame of Chinese/English bilingual poetry text.\n\nSimon also has special message to potential buyers in the auction of inspiration and encouragement.\n\n“The IMAGI-NATION art fund is a \"no-loss\" proposition. Collectors gain the chance to own pieces by esteemed artists, which not only have intrinsic value but also the potential for appreciation. In a broader sense, they're investing in the future—helping to underwrite an endeavour that seeks to cultivate connections capable of changing some of the broken systems in this world.”\nRead the full interview (https://aimementoring.com/2023/11/03/in-conversation-with-simon-chan-from-art-atrium/)\n\n\n** Some of the IMAGI-NATION Gallery Artworks for Auction\n------------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://aimementoring.com/product/u-r-an-i-am-we-are-a-failing-land/\n\nU R an’ I AM, we are a failing land (https://aimementoring.com/product/u-r-an-i-am-we-are-a-failing-land/)\n\nby Blak Douglas (https://aimementoring.com/product/u-r-an-i-am-we-are-a-failing-land/)\n\nMake a bid >> (https://aimementoring.com/product/death/)\nhttps://aimementoring.com/product/the-whale-painting/\n\nThe Whale Painting (https://aimementoring.com/product/the-whale-painting/)\n\nby Dr. Bronwyn Bancroft (https://aimementoring.com/product/the-whale-painting/)\n\nMake a bid >> (https://aimementoring.com/product/death/)\nhttps://aimementoring.com/product/death/\n\nDeath (https://aimementoring.com/product/death/)\n\nby Jack Manning Bancroft (https://aimementoring.com/product/death/)\n\nMake a bid >> (https://aimementoring.com/product/death/)\nSee the full collection here (https://aimementoring.com/gallery/)\n\nReady for a visa?\n\nWatch this 25 minute video (https://aimementoring.com/) on IMAGI-NATION\nhttps://aimementoring.com/\n\n\n** Custodian visa\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12-month commitment for network leaders and changemakers, offering a pathway to mentorship and governance.\nApply (http://aimementoring.com/#visas)\n\n\n** Action Visas\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA 12-month pathway to shift from transactional to relational economies, anchored by specific accreditation outcomes.

By joining IMAGI-NATION, you'll be part of a global network dedicated to building a fairer, more sustainable world through relational economics and systems change.\n\n\"Our economy, in the world of AIME, is a relational economy. It's based on healthy Indigenous patterns of relations, where you give and don't expect anything in return and know it's not a waste of time. It's give-give. We trade as needed, we share our knowledge freely and widely, and in deepening our exchanges, we build an ongoing mentoring continuum of human progress.\n\nAt the centre of our economy isn't a coin, it's a hoodie. A sweatshirt, a common thread.\"\n\nHoodie Economics\n\nThis reflection from Hoodie Economics exemplifies what we're working to achieve with IMAGI-NATION. We're creating a new paradigm where value is measured not just in financial terms, but in the strength of our relationships, the depth of our knowledge sharing, and our collective impact on the world.\n\nOur Action Visas provide:\n* Hands-on experience with IMAGI-NATION Professors\n* Unlikely connections with diverse knowledge and experiences\n* Contributions to open-source IP benefiting nature\n* Accreditation within the IMAGI-NATION economy\n* Opportunities to change the world through mentoring and imagination\n\nStay tuned for our upcoming emails detailing each visa program. Together, we can unleash the collective power of human imagination and create a brighter future for all.\n\nAre you ready to embark on this transformative journey and be part of a relational economy that values give-give over take-take?\n\nImaginatively yours,\n\nThe AIME visa office\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\n\nAs we progress through our five-week communication rollout, you'll discover more about our unique hoodie system. Digital hoodie tokens serve as stepping stones, accumulating to earn the coveted physical hoodies. This innovative approach bridges the digital and physical realms of our relational economy.\n\nThe hoodie design you see isn't a product—it's a story of connection and collaboration. Created during the AIME Puzzle Tour in October 2023, this design embodies the spirit of our relational economy. The tour was a Big Story, a celebration, and a relational performance that brought our community together.\n\nOur journey reached its pinnacle at Bunya Mountain, Queensland. Here, we proudly launched IMAGI-NATION, supported by John Davis, a respected member of our Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs and proud Barunggam and Wakka Wakka Traditional Owner of the land. This launch was a return, a recognition of the deep wisdom and connection to country that underpins our vision.\n\nAs we unfold the stories of our Action Visas over the coming weeks, remember: each hoodie represents a thread in the larger tapestry of IMAGI-NATION, weaving together our shared hopes for a more connected, imaginative, and just world.\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/the-visa-office\n\n\n** A few words from Professor Asterix\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"In the grand recipe of change, hoodies are our secret ingredient. They're a tangible symbol of our interconnectedness, a wearable manifestation of our shared dreams. Each hoodie tells a story of unlikely connections, of knowledge freely given and joyfully received. As we don these hoodies, we're not just wearing a garment—we're embodying a new economic paradigm, one where value is measured in relationships, ideas, and positive impact. So, my dear chefs of change, let's stir up a revolution, one hoodie at a time!\"\n\nProfessor Asterix\n\nProfessor Of Hoodie Economics\n\nIMAGI-NATION{university}\n\n\n** Stay tuned for…\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDino Trance every Wednesday: \"Get hypnotised by change with our weekly Dino Trance - where prehistoric wisdom meets futuristic action!\"\n\nThe Friday Act: \"End your week with action - join The Friday ACT and turn thoughts into world-changing deeds!\"\n\nLightning Quarterly: \"Catch our Lightning updates - electrifying insights that illuminate our collective impact!\"\n\nSunday Kindness: \"Recharge your soul with Sunday Kindness - because a week that begins with compassion changes everything!\"\nmailto:bk@aimementoring.com\nhttps://www.aimementoring.com/\n\nView email in browser (*|ARCHIVE|*)\n*|IFNOT:ARCHIVE_PAGE|**|LIST_ADDRESSLINE_TEXT|**|END:IF|*\nupdate your preferences (*|UPDATE_PROFILE|*) or unsubscribe (*|UNSUB|*)"
