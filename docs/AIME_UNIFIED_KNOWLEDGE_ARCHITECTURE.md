# AIME Unified Knowledge & Relational Economics Architecture

## Vision: The World's Most Advanced Indigenous Knowledge Intelligence Platform

This document outlines the integration architecture for unifying AIME's knowledge systems with the hoodie stock exchange to create a comprehensive relational economics platform.

## Core Integration Principles

### 1. Multi-Tier Validation System
Building on AIME's sophisticated validation methodology:

- **Staff Validation**: Internal AIME team verification
- **Community Validation**: Broader AIME community consensus 
- **Elder Validation**: Indigenous knowledge keepers approval
- **Expert Validation**: Domain specialist verification

### 2. Knowledge-Driven Hoodie Economics
Each hoodie represents validated knowledge and impact:

- **Knowledge Chunks**: Documents broken into searchable, validatable pieces
- **Validation Scores**: Multi-stakeholder consensus drives hoodie value
- **Semantic Relationships**: Knowledge graph connections determine trading possibilities
- **Cultural Protocols**: Indigenous knowledge protocols govern sacred/restricted content

### 3. Living Knowledge Ecosystem
Dynamic, evolving system where knowledge grows through interaction:

- **Seedling → Ancient Tree**: Knowledge maturity progression
- **Real-time Tracking**: Continuous validation and relationship updates  
- **AI-Assisted Discovery**: Automated insight generation and relationship mapping
- **Collaborative Truth-Finding**: Community-driven knowledge refinement

## Technical Architecture

### Data Layer Integration
```
AIME Knowledge Hub (GitHub) 
    ↓ (GitHub API Integration)
Document Processing Pipeline
    ↓ (Vector Embeddings + Chunking)
Knowledge Graph Database (Neo4j)
    ↓ (Semantic Relationships)
Validation System (Multi-Tier)
    ↓ (Consensus Scoring)
Hoodie Stock Exchange (Trading Mechanics)
    ↓ (Value Assignment)
Unified Search Interface
```

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Knowledge documents and chunks
CREATE TABLE knowledge_documents (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  github_path TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  document_type TEXT, -- research, process, philosophy, etc.
  validation_status TEXT,
  cultural_sensitivity_level TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE knowledge_chunks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  document_id TEXT,
  chunk_content TEXT,
  embedding VECTOR(1536), -- Semantic search vector
  validation_scores JSONB, -- Multi-tier validation scores
  relationships TEXT, -- Connected concepts/chunks
  FOREIGN KEY (document_id) REFERENCES knowledge_documents(id)
);

-- Multi-tier validation system
CREATE TABLE validation_votes (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  chunk_id TEXT,
  validator_id TEXT,
  validator_type TEXT, -- staff, community, elder, expert
  vote_score INTEGER, -- -1, 0, 1
  rationale TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (chunk_id) REFERENCES knowledge_chunks(id)
);

-- Enhanced hoodie-knowledge connections
ALTER TABLE hoodies ADD COLUMN knowledge_requirements JSONB;
ALTER TABLE hoodies ADD COLUMN validation_threshold REAL;
ALTER TABLE hoodies ADD COLUMN cultural_protocols JSONB;
```

## Key Features

### 1. GitHub Integration
- **Automated Sync**: Pull AIME Knowledge Hub documents via GitHub API
- **Change Detection**: Track document updates and trigger reprocessing
- **Markdown Processing**: Convert GitHub markdown to structured knowledge chunks
- **Metadata Extraction**: Parse frontmatter and document structure

### 2. Semantic Search & Discovery
- **Vector Embeddings**: Generate semantic representations of all content
- **Cross-Content Search**: Search across documents, videos, newsletters, hoodies
- **Relationship Discovery**: AI-powered connection identification
- **Contextual Results**: Results ranked by relevance and validation scores

### 3. Validation-Driven Trading
- **Knowledge Verification**: Hoodies require validated knowledge engagement
- **Consensus Mechanics**: Multi-stakeholder agreement drives hoodie value
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Indigenous protocols protect sacred knowledge
- **Dynamic Valuation**: Hoodie worth fluctuates based on validation scores

### 4. Intelligence Layer
- **Breakthrough Detection**: AI identifies novel insights and connections
- **Concept Evolution**: Track how ideas develop over time
- **Impact Measurement**: Quantify knowledge application and outcomes
- **Wisdom Preservation**: Ensure Indigenous knowledge integrity

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)

- [ ] Publication and sharing systems
- [ ] Global impact tracking

## Cultural Considerations

### Indigenous Knowledge Protocols
- **Permission Systems**: Explicit consent for sharing sacred knowledge
- **Attribution Requirements**: Proper crediting of knowledge sources
- **Access Controls**: Restrict sensitive content to appropriate audiences
- **Elder Oversight**: Indigenous knowledge keepers maintain governance

### Validation Sensitivity
- **Cultural Context**: Validation criteria respect Indigenous epistemologies
- **Multiple Ways of Knowing**: Honor different knowledge systems equally
- **Power Dynamics**: Prevent colonial validation impositions
- **Reciprocity**: Ensure knowledge sharing benefits originating communities

## Success Metrics

### Knowledge Quality
- Validation consensus scores
- Cross-referencing accuracy
- Cultural appropriateness ratings
- Community engagement levels

### System Adoption

## Conclusion

This unified architecture transforms AIME's fragmented knowledge assets into a coherent, intelligent, and culturally respectful system. By connecting the hoodie stock exchange to validated knowledge, we create genuine value alignment between recognition, learning, and impact.

The platform becomes not just a knowledge repository, but a living ecosystem where wisdom grows, relationships deepen, and indigenous knowledge systems are honored and preserved for future generations.
