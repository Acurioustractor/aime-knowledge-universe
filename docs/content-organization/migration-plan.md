## Overview

The purpose-based content organization system organizes content based on its primary purpose rather than its source or format. This migration plan outlines the process for migrating existing content to this new system.

## Migration Process

The migration process will be performed in phases:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Analyze existing content and identify its purpose
2. **Classification Phase**: Classify content by purpose
3. **Enhancement Phase**: Add purpose-specific details to content
4. **Testing Phase**: Test the migrated content
5. **Deployment Phase**: Deploy the migrated content

## Content Sources

The following content sources will be migrated:

1. **YouTube Videos**: Videos from the IMAGI-NATION {TV} YouTube channel
2. **Mailchimp Newsletters**: Newsletters from the IMAGI-NATION Mailchimp account
3. **Airtable Records**: Records from the IMAGI-NATION Airtable base
4. **GitHub Repositories**: Documents from the IMAGI-NATION GitHub repositories
5. **Local Files**: Files from the local file system

## Migration Steps

### 1. Analysis Phase

1. **Inventory Existing Content**:
   - List all content items from each source
   - Identify content type, format, and metadata
   - Estimate the volume of content to be migrated

2. **Define Purpose Mapping Rules**:
   - Define rules for mapping content to purposes
   - Create a mapping table for content types to purposes
   - Identify edge cases and special handling requirements

### 2. Classification Phase

1. **Implement Purpose Classifier**:
   - Implement the purpose classifier based on the mapping rules
   - Test the classifier with sample content
   - Refine the classifier based on test results

2. **Batch Classification**:
   - Classify all content items in batches
   - Review classification results
   - Manually correct misclassifications

### 3. Enhancement Phase

1. **Add Purpose-Specific Details**:
   - Add purpose-specific details to content items
   - Generate missing details where possible
   - Flag content items that need manual enhancement

2. **Enrich Content Metadata**:
   - Add themes, topics, and tags to content items
   - Generate relationships between content items
   - Add missing metadata where possible

### 4. Testing Phase

1. **Verify Classification**:
   - Verify that content is correctly classified by purpose
   - Check that purpose-specific details are correct
   - Ensure that relationships between content items are meaningful

2. **Test Content Access**:
   - Test that content can be accessed through the new system
   - Verify that content filtering works correctly
   - Check that search functionality returns relevant results

### 5. Deployment Phase

1. **Gradual Rollout**:
   - Enable feature flags for core features
   - Deploy the system to a staging environment
   - Test the system with real users
   - Gather feedback and make adjustments

2. **Full Deployment**:
   - Enable all feature flags
   - Deploy the system to production
   - Monitor system performance and user feedback
   - Make adjustments as needed

## Analytics Implementation

To track user engagement and measure the effectiveness of the purpose-based content organization system, we will implement analytics tracking throughout the system.

### 1. Key Metrics

The following key metrics will be tracked:

1. **Content Discovery Metrics**:
   - Page views by purpose hub
   - Time spent on purpose hubs
   - Click-through rates from purpose hubs to content items
   - Navigation paths between purpose hubs

2. **Search and Filter Metrics**:
   - Search queries by purpose filter
   - Filter usage statistics
   - Search result click-through rates
   - Search abandonment rates

3. **Content Engagement Metrics**:
   - Content views by purpose
   - Time spent on content items by purpose
   - Related content click-through rates
   - Content sharing rates

4. **Purpose Classification Metrics**:
   - Purpose classification accuracy (via user feedback)
   - Content items with multiple purposes
   - User-suggested purpose changes
   - Classification confidence scores

### 2. Analytics Implementation

1. **Event Tracking**:
   - Implement event tracking for user interactions
   - Track navigation between purpose hubs
   - Track filter and search usage
   - Track content views and engagement

2. **Custom Dimensions**:
   - Create custom dimensions for content purposes
   - Create custom dimensions for content themes
   - Create custom dimensions for content sources
   - Create custom dimensions for user roles

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Create a purpose-based content analytics dashboard
   - Visualize content engagement by purpose
   - Track purpose classification accuracy
   - Monitor user navigation patterns

### 3. User Feedback Collection

1. **In-App Feedback**:
   - Implement purpose classification feedback mechanism
   - Add content usefulness ratings
   - Collect suggestions for content organization improvements
   - Track feature flag usage and feedback

2. **Feedback Analysis**:
   - Analyze user feedback by user role
   - Identify patterns in purpose classification feedback
   - Track changes in user satisfaction over time
   - Use feedback to refine purpose classification rules

### 4. Continuous Improvement

1. **A/B Testing**:
   - Test different purpose classification rules
   - Test different purpose hub layouts
   - Test different related content algorithms
   - Test different search result presentations

2. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Use analytics data to refine purpose classification
   - Adjust content presentation based on engagement metrics
   - Optimize search and filtering based on usage patterns
   - Update navigation based on user paths

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues during the migration, the following rollback plan will be implemented:

1. **Disable Feature Flags**:
   - Disable all feature flags related to the purpose-based content organization system
   - Revert to the previous content organization system

2. **Restore Content**:
   - Restore content from backups if necessary
   - Verify that content is accessible through the previous system

3. **Notify Users**:
   - Notify users of the rollback
   - Provide instructions for accessing content through the previous system

## Testing

The following testing will be performed during the migration:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test individual components of the purpose-based content organization system
   - Verify that components work as expected

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the integration of components
   - Verify that components work together as expected

3. **System Testing**:
   - Test the entire system
   - Verify that the system meets requirements

4. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Test the system with real users
   - Gather feedback and make adjustments

## Timeline

The migration will be performed according to the following timeline:

1. **Analysis Phase**: 1 week
2. **Classification Phase**: 2 weeks
3. **Enhancement Phase**: 2 weeks
4. **Testing Phase**: 1 week
5. **Deployment Phase**: 2 weeks

Total: 8 weeks
