# User Testing Facilitator Script: Content Organization by Purpose

## Introduction (5 minutes)

Hello and thank you for participating in this user testing session. My name is [Facilitator Name], and I'll be guiding you through today's session.

We're testing a new approach to organizing content in the IMAGI-NATION Wiki that focuses on the purpose of content rather than its source. Your feedback will help us improve this system.

A few important things to note:
- We're testing the system, not you. There are no right or wrong answers.
- Please think aloud as you complete tasks. Share your thoughts, expectations, and reactions.
- I may ask questions as you work, but I'm here to learn from you, not to guide you.
- The session will last about 60 minutes and will be recorded for later analysis.
- Your participation is voluntary. You can take a break or stop at any time.

Do you have any questions before we begin?
