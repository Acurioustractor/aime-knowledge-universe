# AIME Mentoring Methodology
*Core Knowledge Anchor Document*

## Revolutionary Approach: Mentoring as Systems Change Technology

AIME's mentoring methodology goes far beyond traditional one-on-one relationships to create **systematic transformation through relational networks**. This approach recognizes mentoring as a powerful technology for:

- **Knowledge transfer across cultural boundaries**
- **Systems change through relationship building**
- **Community development through wisdom sharing**
- **Economic transformation through relational value creation**

## Core Principles

### 1. **Relationship First, Task Second**
- All learning happens within the context of relationship
- Trust and connection precede skill development
- Cultural safety enables authentic engagement
- Long-term relationship building over short-term outcomes

### 2. **Indigenous Wisdom as Foundation**
- Elder knowledge holders guide methodology development
- Traditional kinship models inform mentor/mentee relationships
- Cultural protocol ensures respectful knowledge sharing
- Country-centered thinking provides grounding

### 3. **Collective Rather Than Individual Focus**
- Mentoring circles replace isolated pairs
- Community outcomes prioritized over individual advancement
- Ripple effects and network impact measured
- Shared wisdom benefits entire communities

### 4. **Systems Perspective Integration**
- Mentors help mentees see their place in larger systems
- Understanding interconnection and impact
- Developing systems literacy through relationship
- Creating change agents for community transformation

## The AIME Mentoring Model

### **Three-Tier Structure**

#### **Tier 1: Elders (Wisdom Keepers)**
- Indigenous knowledge holders and community elders
- Experienced practitioners in their fields
- Guardians of cultural protocol and traditional wisdom
- Guides for ethical and sustainable practice

#### **Tier 2: Mentors (Bridge Builders)**
- Young adults (typically 18-25) from similar backgrounds to mentees
- Have navigated systems successfully while maintaining cultural identity
- Trained in AIME methodology and cultural competency
- Active learners continuing their own development

#### **Tier 3: Mentees (Future Leaders)**
- Young people (typically 12-18) from Indigenous and marginalized communities
- Seeking pathways to higher education and meaningful careers
- Developing leadership capacity and systems awareness
- Future mentors in the ongoing cycle

### **Circular Flow of Wisdom**
Unlike linear mentoring models, AIME creates circular flows where:
- Mentees become mentors in ongoing cycles
- Elders learn from younger generations
- Knowledge flows in all directions
- Everyone teaches and everyone learns
