# AIME Systems Transformation Model
*Core Knowledge Anchor Document*

## Beyond Reform: Regenerative Systems Change

AIME's approach to systems transformation moves beyond incremental reform to create **regenerative change** that heals historical harms while building completely new ways of organizing. This model integrates Indigenous wisdom with systems science to create lasting, life-affirming transformation.

## Foundational Principles

### **Indigenous Systems Thinking**
Drawing from tens of thousands of years of sustainable social organization:

- **Circular causality** instead of linear problem-solving
- **Seven-generation thinking** for long-term sustainability
- **Kinship systems** as organizational models
- **Country-centered** decision making
- **Elder wisdom** integrated with youth innovation
- **Ceremony and ritual** as change technologies

### **Relational Systems Architecture**
Building systems around relationships rather than transactions:

- **Trust as infrastructure** for all other functions
- **Story and narrative** as data and decision-making tools
- **Community validation** rather than expert authority
- **Collective intelligence** over individual brilliance
- **Emergent leadership** instead of fixed hierarchies
