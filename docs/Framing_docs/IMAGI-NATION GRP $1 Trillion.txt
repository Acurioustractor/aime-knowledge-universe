IMAGI-NATION - GRP (Gross Relational Potential) $1 Trillion +  Welcome to IMAGI-NATION a digital nation that is focused on alleviating inequity for human kind and all other species by turbocharging the 6000 people/entities we believe after 20 years of in the field research can be the headwater to shift the health of life on earth.  The 6000 entities we have identified have a collective impact reach of at least 32 million people. We focus on the entities that can impact 10000 people over the course of a lifetime (60 years), and then we help them deepen the depth of their impact so the impact can increase to reach to 100K people and deepen relations with nature.  AIME has founded IMAGI-NATION and one measurement of our early mentoring work valued our return to Aus economy at $1.1 Billion, the JOY Corp model we have created as a pathway to relational health and wealth for organisations will see 1000 Joy Corps apply the first iteration of the AIME Mentoring model as one of 70+ activations, including creating nature funds, a peace index, kindness economics and other measurement systems which sit in the non financial at this current time. The potential value of the mentoring component alone for JOY Corps could see $1 Trillion returned to the global economy relationally. Without any further impact measurement.  We have valued that each of the 6000 entities impact could after their time in IMAGI-NATION see an increase of 10K worth of value to each national economy. LOOK AT THOMAS Mathematics to 10 Quntillion USD. [ADD In a nutshell, this is using Metcalfe’s law, assumptions on the total network built by IMAGI-NATION and assumption of the value creation per person in the network through the network - assumptions that lead to 10QN: 32.000.000 people in the network across 10 years + 10K USD value creation per person]  Value of Network In order to value the network created by Imagination we use Metcalf formula. Suppose there are n nodes in the network. The number of relations in the network can be calculated as follows:  Number of relations = n(n-1)/2 where n= number of nodes  So in imagination the number of relations table will form as follows: Nodes Number of relations 5 10 15 105 35 595 150 11,175 500 124,750 1500 1,124,250 5000 12,497,500   If we extrapolate that every relation has a value A, the Value of the network can be formulated as follows: V = n(A*(n-1)/2) where A= Average value created by each relation=10,000USD per relation 10000  The Value of network thus becomes increasing at dunbar scale Nodes Number of relations Value of Network 5 10 100,000 15 105 1,050,000 35 595 5,950,000 150 11,175 111,750,000 500 124,750 1,247,500,000 1500 1,124,250 11,242,500,000 5000 12,497,500 124,975,000,000   Adding relation of 5 people, the UNCx5 Algorithm, in this analysis where every possible node can be placed in a UNCx5 The initial one UNCx5 has 5 nodes and 10 relations, adding another node (6th) can form 15 relations,  but another 5 UNCx5's. Adding the 7th node, would increase the relations to 21 and 21 uncx5s This can be formulated as follows:  Number of UNCx5 = nCr= n!/(n-r)!r! where n= number of nodes, r= 5, one UNCx5.  Nodes Numver of relations Number of UNCx5 5 10 1 6 15 6 7 21 21 8 28 56 9 36 126 10 45 252 15 105 3,003 35 595 324,632 150 11,175 591,600,030 500 124,750 255,244,687,600 1500 1,124,250 #NUM! 5000 12,497,500 #NUM! 6000 17,997,000 #NUM!  In order to value the network now with the number of potential UNCx5's we need to value each UNCx5  Value of each relation is 10000 USD Value of each 5 people in a UNCx5 relation(10 combinations) is 100000 USD 100000 The Value of the network now becomes  Nodes Number of relations Number of UNCx5 Potential Value of Network 5 10 1 100,000 6 15 6 600,000 7 21 21 2,100,000 8 28 56 5,600,000 9 36 126 12,600,000 10 45 252 25,200,000 15 105 3,003 300,300,000 35 595 324,632 32,463,200,000 150 11,175 591,600,030 59,160,003,000,000 500 124,750 255,244,687,600 25,524,468,760,000,000 1500 1,124,250 #NUM! #NUM! 5000 12,497,500 #NUM! #NUM! 6000 17,997,000 #NUM! #NUM!   Impact Measure of IMAGINATION Input Number of Nodes Input Number of UNCx5's  Value of Network calculated from above formulae at anypoint by inputting above numbers.   Assumptions:  Average value of each relation is assumed to be nominal 10,000USD.  The average value of a UNCx5 is assumed to be sum of all relations average value in a network of 5.  #NUM! Indicates numbers are incalculable via Excel and tend toward infinity.  In terms of potential market value that lies ahead there is a minimum $750 billion nature based marketplace that has yet to be unlocked, and the R&D value of the 6000 entities looking to unlock custodial economies, centre the design depth and quality is worth at least $1 Billion of that share with the 1000 Joy Corps, 1000 Indigenous Knowledge labs working on solving the nature economy pathway as the labs consulting to leaders across the earth - it’s more likely that the potential market share is some accusation of all the GDP around the world, that showcases the investment in the move to well being measurements.  When we look at governments we may ask what is the R&D value of securing a parallel measurement system to GDP that includes JOY, kindness, nature, peace, would it count in around 1% worth of all GDP globally? Say total GDP is around 88 Billion, a further 1 Billion to well being score?1 And then if we look to deep entrenched inequity, in areas outside the margins what can we learn from death, from magic, from returning to relations with the water, from the power of the sun, what is the total value of unlocking energy for all of human life?2  In the toolshed what is the value of a knowledge text passed on? Of 100 texts that pass on deep long knowledge? The IP of IMAGI-NATION and code all open sourced? What is the value of 1000s of years of knowledge translated into IMAGINE Film? The value of the Professors bringing mentors into every home? OF the mentor app providing a pathway for all citizens to be trained as mentors?  The network values the action, and we focus on the relation between each actor, we believe one unlikely connection can change the world, that it creates imagination, and when harnessed with a kinship system and growth across a UNCx5 we can see a force multiplier that moves at a depth of relational quality that adds another dimension to the metcalf theory whereby we activate kinship mapping models in the internet with UNCx5 growth fusion. We then map the health of the network the focused actors to a limit of the number of faces we can know as per Dunbar research and then watch the river run from there.  Then what may be the potential of all of this in IMAGI-NATION, of our collective imagination, what price may we put on this? Maybe time will tell, maybe we will never be able to measure it.  With value of GRP (Gross Relational Potential) of over trillions of $, we believe after 20 years of evidence based research that we are well placed to help humanity unlock it’s potential and economic prosperity in relation to nature not abstracted from it.  Welcome to IMAGI-NATION By JMB founder
