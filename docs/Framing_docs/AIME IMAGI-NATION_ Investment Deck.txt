DEAR INVESTORS, We are raising $100M US to cover the networks life -10 years. We have capped the amount we areraising and limited the amount of investors in the project. We won't be having other funding rounds, orcoming back 5 years later saying, now we want to build a martian embassy, this is it, a relation networkfor the world, built on Indigenous systems thinking, to be a lab for humanity to accelerate our progressand build a healthier, more intelligent, synergetic world for all. The financial investment of the 100M is one piece AND as important to us is the intelligence and relationswith the people investing, we have a chance to change the way the world works, to fuse together thedifferent playgrounds of human intelligence &create models and systems for a healthier more joyful earth for all it's inhabitants. This investment will directly change the lives of millions, role model a relational network, leave behindthe songlines for 1000s of years to come. The following story will showcase the challenges in how we are networked, our solution, and thepotential of what lays ahead. The following gathers the best of our collective intelligence in the story of our work, it should be about 23 hours worth of digestion, we hope you enjoy. Let us now zoom out, look at the problem we face, and the proposed road ahead, including how wereached our solution, and we'll look forward to catching you on the other side. Enjoy. The AIME Team 3 ,2 ,1 Okay let's go, what's up wth the current way we are networked? OUR CURRENT CONNECTIONS… work towards a concentration of wealth and opportunity for the few,a confirmation of our biases, more time with people like us. This has led to an… UNFAIR WORLD. TO CREATE A FAIRER WORLD we need different connections, between races, ages, wealth and nations. WELCOME TO UNLIKELY CONNECTIONS FOR A FAIRER WORLD THE AIME BACKSTORY (CLICKTHE WINDOWS) FAST UNESCO TOP50 COMPANY'S WORLD ORGANISATIONS IMAGIHARVARD IMPACT GLOBAL CHANGING RESEACH NATION{TV} IN EDUCATION KPMG COALITION IDEA PARTNERSHIP IMPACT CASE STUDY ECONOMIC REPORT GOLD EVALUATION AWARD IN SOCIAL IMPACT NOW WE BUILD UPON WHAT AIME HAS ALREADY CREATED IMAGI-NATION LIBRARY, CINEMA, RADIO GLOBAL MENTORING {UNIVERSITY} STATION & TV NETWORK NETWORK A training ground for Global Sharing knowledge, intelligence More than 25,000 mentees and Ambassadors of Equality and stories. 10,000 mentors and counting. AWARDS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Honourable Mention – Top 50 2017 2021 2021 2019 Global Education Gold Award Education Fast Organisations in Coalition Member for Social Impact Company Education Global Forum for UNESCO Good Design Awards World Changing Ideas Awards Education and Learning WITHIN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS… AIME HAS BEEN FUELLING UNLIKELY CONNECTIONS ACROSS 52 COUNTRIES. "Our lives are the behaviours that we value -and they are definitely open to manipulation byhealthy and unhealthy actors.

We lined up 50 one-hour co-design sessions with 50 unlikely connections, moving across 10 countries—from a teenage entrepreneur in India, to a former Prime Minister in Australia, to a writer in Kenya, on to one of the lead producers of immersive theatre globally in LA. We entered with a blank page, and over the course of the 50 hours, a story found us, cowritten by all of these people, and the story was finished as A Night in IMAGI-NATION. SEE THE FULL LISTRHIANMILLERADAMDAVIDS"…it has been the depth ofthese unlikely connections thattime and time again hasprovided me with ideas,inspiration and practicalstrategies to break downinternal and external barriers to create a better future for the next generation." JOHNYMAIRAIME and IMAGI-NATION has already delivered so muchimpact for me as a person andfor Ethic as a team. I am in this till the end and will offer all mytime and energy to make itcome to life""…that was the start of realizing that youcould create unlikely connections by justcreating whatever it was you wanted to,and that it didn't have to be, you know,the reality that you were living in.” GREGHUTCHINSONROSEANNALEDDY"The ‘aha’moment for me was when I realised just how much of my life’s journey has been shaped by unlikelyconnections. From that point I couldplace myself on the journey.” "We won’t create lasting change in theworld, unless we also have a deeplyhuman transformation. What words do we want to use to anchor the conversation?” BRONWYN BANCROFT “A lot of the areas we are workingthrough have belonged to a very elitegroup across many countries acrossthe world.
