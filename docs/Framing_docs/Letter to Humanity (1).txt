The future of human life on Earth depends on our ability to shift our economies and societies to work in harmony with nature. A staggering $125 trillion marketplace centred on nature-positive solutions awaits us (World Economic Forum, 2022). But unlocking this potential requires a fundamental reimagining of our relationships - with each other, with our systems, and with the natural world.  The key to this transformation lies not with those who have benefited most from our current economic models, but with those who have been pushed to the margins. Indigenous peoples, marginalised groups, and others who have maintained deep connections to nature hold invaluable knowledge and perspectives. By bringing these voices to the forefront and fusing them with forward-thinking leaders from within existing power structures, we can chart a new course.  IMAGI-NATION is the laboratory for this grand experiment. We are calling on citizens of Earth from all walks of life to join us in building bridges between our current economies and the nature-centred future we must create. Whether you're a corporate leader looking to transform your organisation into a Joy Corp for Nature, an educator ready to establish an Imagination School for Nature, or an individual eager to become a Systems Change Citizen for Nature - there's a place for you in IMAGI-NATION. "Here, we will..."  Mentor from nature  Practice custodianship for nature  Activate Indigenous knowledge systems labs for nature  Empower presidents for nature  Create tools for nature  Share knowledge for nature  Embassy with nature  Work towards unlocking $125 trillion for nature  Redefine human life as valued in nature This is not just about moving money.
