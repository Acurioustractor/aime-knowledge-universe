## Summary:

* Context: The speaker, Jack, begins by acknowledging past generations and the inherited problems of colonialism, social networks, and the unsustainable use of natural resources. He highlights that historical power structures, amplified by modern social media, have concentrated wealth and influence, commodified attention, and created an imbalance with nature.  
* IMAGI-NATIONs Purpose: Imagination is presented as a "digital country" and "relational network" designed to address these problems. It's an alternative to social networks, built on different principles:  
  * No data harvesting or advertising.  
  * Barriers to entry, encouraging focused work.  
  * Emphasis on unlikely connections to combat echo chambers.  
  * A parallel credit system (hoodies) valuing relational potential.  
  * Open-source and designed with an intentional "death date" (10 years) to be a bridge to future nation-states.  
* Change Logic: Imagination focuses on nine pathways to shift individuals' perspectives:  
  * Default Settings: Helping users become aware of and potentially change their ingrained digital habits.  
  * Relational Reorientation: Using Indigenous knowledge systems to map and improve users' relationships with others and the environment.  
  * Systems Design: Empowering users to design solutions by understanding the interconnectedness of systems.  
  * Action: Focusing on practical, systemic change, particularly in shifting economies.  
  * Wandering: Curation of film to encourage exploration.  
  * Tools: Creating collaborative, open-source tools (like co-created books) and case studies for knowledge transfer.  
  * Capital: A parallel credit system using "hoodies" as tokens of reputational credit.  
  * Trading Capabilities: A club for members who have completed the initial work, allowing exchange of jobs, opportunities, and knowledge.  
  * CoLab: Developing protocols for collaboration, discourse, and communication between humans and with other species.

## Key Players:

* 5,000 Action Visa Holders: Individuals with the potential to impact 10,000 people each, across five groups:  
  * Joy Corporations: Businesses focused on relational impact, not just profit.  
  * Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs: Bringing Indigenous knowledge to the forefront of design.  
  * Young People: Re-establishing custodial economies.  
  * Schools: Acting as "Imagination Labs" fostering custodianship and imagination.  
  * Systems Change Citizens: Individuals working on systemic change in a collaborative, non-heroic way.  
  * 150 tool makers  
  * 130 System Change Residents  
  * 50 Embassy Stories  
* Governance: Based on three circles (universal imagination, mentoring, and custodianship), AIME's 20-year network, and peer-to-peer mapping (Dunbar's number and kinship models). There are 150 "custodians" responsible for specific parts of the network.  
* Impact Measurement: Gross Relational Potential (GRP) is proposed as a supplement to GDP, measuring the value of relationships between humans and between humans and other species. Tools include a "message stick" (an Indigenous carved measurement system) and a "hoodie stock exchange."  
* The final section covered questions concerning job accreditation and the utilization of indigenous languages.

**Here are some core contextualised quotes from the transcript that help explain Imagi-nation and AIME, grouped by theme:**

1\. The Problem AIME and Imagination Address:

* Colonialism and Inequality:

   "...in the short-ish history of 1,000 odd years plus...there's four to five really significant colonial empires that went about and explicitly divided the world and said, we control this and we control the wealth...and then all of these places that we've conquered...none of you are even human..."

  * Context: This highlights the historical roots of inequality and the inherited "network problem" of power concentration.  
* The Attention Economy:

   "...the social networks...have been so gnarly in how they've been able to garner such a significant bandwidth of our time and space...where you look becomes what you think and then what you think becomes what you know..."

  * Context: This explains the modern problem of social networks commodifying attention and shaping thought patterns.  
* Environmental Crisis:

   "...we have a nature problem. We have a problem with our nature and how it relates to nature and the bridge between the two being our energy relations...the earth tip out of balance..."

  * Context: This points to the unsustainable relationship between humanity and the environment, another key network problem.

2\. Imagination's Purpose and Design:

* A Digital Country/Relational Network:

   "...imagination is...the first network state built into the internet with governance and with structures...an alternative to the social networks..."

  * Context: This defines Imagination's core nature as a new type of digital entity, contrasting it with existing social networks.  
* Unlikely Connections:

   "...addressing that by creating a network of unlikely connections that allows for movement upstream...you're moving people to connect with people that they don't know and with knowledge that they don't know..."

  * Context: This emphasizes the importance of breaking out of echo chambers and fostering new relationships.  
* Gross Relational Potential (GRP):

   "...we can create at the very least a parallel set of measurements that can enhance the context around GDP...gross relational potential...the value of the space in between each node in a network."

  * Context: This introduces GRP as an alternative metric focusing on the value of relationships, not just economic output.  
* Intentional Death Date:

   "...we've set ourselves a 10 year lifespan...a bridge hopefully between the nation states of today to where we need to get to tomorrow..."

  * Context: This highlights Imagination's limited lifespan, designed to be a catalyst for change, not a permanent solution.  
* "Imagination is all open source. Anyone that wants to code can take it tomorrow and build their own version of imagination and it's our hope that there will be many versions of imaginations of it in the coming years and definitely after our death date"

  * Context: This demonstrates that it is not intended to be the only solution, and others are free to modify.

3\. AIME's Role:

* Responsibility:

   "...AIME is responsible for Imagination...i'm the ceo of the joint for now and...i'll ultimately be responsible if something goes wrong inside the network..."

  * Context: This clarifies AIME's role as the organization that built and is accountable for Imagination.  
* 20 Years of Experience:

   "...we've moved in embassy for 18 years. And it's my hope that people that go into building digital networks in the future spend at least 20 years in the field with scar tissue of knowing people before they start to play god in the internet..." "...grown through a 20-year network as a second way that we built the governance..."

  * Context: This emphasizes AIME's long history of working with communities, providing a foundation for Imagination's design.  
* Custodianship Model

"...35 of us, even if we're extraordinary inside of AIM, cannot govern this thing alone. So it's why we've set it up to be a network of networks...So all of these pieces like the Joy Corporation or Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs were built for what already exists. So we're bringing in custodians of the network..." \* Context: Explaining shared leadership, and distributed responsibility.

4\. The Importance of Relationships:

* Relational Capital:

   "...what is the energy current that moves between those two humans? What is that worth?...what happens when the human spirit is up when energy is up what happens to our capacity to be able to move to relate to each other..."

  * Context: This highlights the focus on valuing and measuring the strength of relationships.  
* Hoodies as Tokens:

   "...we've created passports, and then people will get credits, digital hoodies and then be able to ladder up to physical hoodies which will give them capital inside imagination. It'll also give them capital outside."

  * Context: Explains the use of "hoodies" (both digital and physical) as a system of recognizing and rewarding relational contributions.  
* Give it away to keep it:

   "...when you give into a network, you know, it's not a waste of time and you're not expecting anything in return because, you know, it's going to keep moving around."

  * Context: Explains the approach to generating value and reciprocity within the relational network.

These quotes, taken together, provide a concise overview of the problems Imagination aims to solve, its core design principles, AIME's role, and the emphasis on relationships as a central form of value. They show how Imagi-nation is intended to be a fundamentally different kind of online space, driven by a different set of values than traditional social networks or economic models.

## Dunbar’s Number

Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.1 These are relationships where an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. While the exact number is debated, it's commonly cited as around 150\. Robin Dunbar, a British anthropologist, proposed this limit based on research into primate brain size and group size, extrapolating to humans.  
Here's how Dunbar's number plays into AIME and Imagination:

* Governance Structure: Imagination's governance is explicitly designed around Dunbar's number. AIME recognizes that a small team (even their 35 staff) cannot govern a complex network like Imagination alone.  
* Layers of Relationships: Dunbar proposed layers of relationship circles. Common numbers include 5, 15, 50, 150, and 500, with 150 being a particularly important threshold. Imagination uses these numbers:  
  * Unlikely Connections of Five (UNC5): Every participant in Imagination is placed in a group of five, forming their core support network. This is the smallest, most intimate layer, echoing Dunbar's innermost circle. It combines Dunbar's Number with Indigenous kinship models.  
  * 150 Custodians: Each year, 150 individuals will be designated as "custodians" of the network, responsible for a specific part of Imagination. This aligns with Dunbar's number for stable, meaningful relationships. The idea is that these 150 individuals can genuinely know and relate to each other, fostering shared responsibility.  
  * Growth Strategy: Imagination's rollout of "visas" is intentionally slow, increasing at the "rate of relations." They start small (15 visas initially) and grow organically, allowing relationships to form before expanding the network. This avoids overwhelming the system and allows for the development of genuine connections, reflecting Dunbar's concept of relationship limits.  
  * Goal of 150 relationships. The network encourages people to form unlikely relationships outside their normal group, and grow their network intentionally up to 150\.  
  * 5,000 Action Visa Holders: This larger number represents the overall target population for Imagination. While it's beyond Dunbar's number for close relationships, it aligns with Dunbar's research on the maximum number of faces people can generally recognize (though not necessarily have a relationship with). It's a practical limit for the scale of the project.  
* 50 embassy locations

In essence, AIME is using Dunbar's number as a guiding principle for building a relational network, not just a large, anonymous one. They are prioritizing the quality and depth of connections, believing that this is crucial for trust, collaboration, and effective governance. They are consciously scaling the network in a way that respects the cognitive limits of human relationships. This contrasts sharply with the design of many social networks, which prioritise vast numbers of connections over depth.

## KBTs

KBTs: A New Form of Value within Imagination

KBTs are a core component of Imagination's economic and incentive system. They are designed to:

1. Fund Projects: KBTs act as a fundraising mechanism for projects within Imagination. Instead of traditional donations, supporters "purchase" KBTs linked to specific projects.  
2. Represent Project Outcomes: Each KBT is directly tied to a project led by a "Professor" (a puppet character representing a specific area of focus) within Imagination. The KBT represents the value generated by the outcomes of that project. This is crucial: it's not just about funding the activity, but about tying investment to the results.  
3. Dynamic Value: The value of a KBT is not fixed. It fluctuates annually based on the project's success in achieving its goals. If the project performs well and creates positive impact (as measured by Imagination's metrics), the KBT's value increases. This creates a direct incentive for projects to deliver real-world results.  
4. Transparency and Security: KBTs are built on blockchain technology (specifically, they are a type of NFT \- Non-Fungible Token). This provides:  
   * Transparency: All transactions (purchase, value adjustments, trading) are recorded on the blockchain, creating a public, immutable record.  
   * Security: Blockchain technology makes the system resistant to fraud and manipulation.  
   * Ownership: Purchasing a KBT gives the holder clear, verifiable ownership of a digital asset tied to the project.  
5. Tradability: Holders can trade KBTs within the Imagination ecosystem. This creates a secondary market where the value of a KBT can fluctuate based on perceived project success and demand.  
6. Redemption: Holders may choose to redeem their KBT, to gain access to benefits.  
7. Democratize Knowledge: Anyone can purchase, hold, or trade.

How it Relates to AIME and Imagination's Goals

* Funding the Vision: AIME, as the creator of Imagination, is using KBTs as a novel way to fund the various initiatives within this "digital country." It moves beyond traditional grant funding or donations.  
* Incentivizing Impact: The dynamic value of KBTs directly aligns with Imagination's focus on Gross Relational Potential (GRP) and measurable impact. Projects are incentivized to deliver real-world results, not just complete activities, because that's what drives the value of their associated KBTs.  
* Creating a Parallel Economy: KBTs represent a step towards building the parallel economy that Jack discusses in the town hall. It's a system of value exchange that is distinct from traditional fiat currencies and is tied to relational and ecological outcomes.  
* Supporting Systemic Change: By purchasing KBTs, individuals are directly supporting the projects within Imagination that are working towards systemic change (e.g., Joy Corporations, Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs, etc.). It's a way to participate in and benefit from the positive changes Imagination aims to create.  
* Open Source Principles: The use of blockchain and the eventual goal of open-sourcing the measurement tools (like the message stick) aligns with Imagination's open-source ethos.

**In Simple Terms**

Imagine you want to support a project within Imagination that's focused on restoring oyster reefs in New York City (the "$1B oyster project" led by Professor Ocean Ethic). Instead of donating, you buy an "Ocean Ethic KBT." If the project succeeds in restoring oyster populations and improving water quality, the value of your KBT goes up. You could then potentially sell it for a profit, or hold onto it as a representation of your contribution to that positive change. If the project fails, the KBT's value would decrease. This creates a direct link between your investment and the project's real-world impact.

**Key Differences from Traditional NFTs**

While KBTs are a type of NFT, they differ significantly from the typical use case of NFTs (digital art, collectibles, etc.):

* Utility, Not Just Ownership: KBTs are not primarily about owning a unique digital item. They are about representing and participating in the value created by a real-world project.  
* Dynamic Valuation: Most NFTs have a value determined by market speculation. KBTs have a value that is intended to be tied to measurable outcomes, although market forces will still likely play a role.  
* Social Impact Focus: KBTs are explicitly designed to fund and incentivize projects with positive social and environmental impact, unlike many NFTs which are purely commercial.

The KBT model is an experiment in creating a new kind of economic system that aligns financial incentives with positive social and ecological outcomes. It's a key part of how AIME and Imagination hope to achieve their ambitious goals.

## Transcript

Okay, hello everybody. Morning, evening. We've got a mixture of a lot of the core AIM team here and then there's a few guests that have dropped in from different locations. So hello to people that haven't met before and the intention of these town halls are just to take the time to talk through the engineering and the beats inside imagination this digital country that we've built and the architecture we've been working on for for this next phase as it sort of goes from design phase into kind of implementation so there's there's three hours penciled in there's a presentation i've got which should go for like no longer than an hour probably more like 45 hopefully but yeah happy for it to be a space of of dialogue and conversation and then there's scope for us to just sort of follow the the insights and the questions and the queries about some things that might have been presented and going a little tour through imagination and build that out. So yeah, we're going to do three or so of these, not trying to like, you know, broadcast it far and wide and it's not about like millions of people watching. It's just about us sharing and trying to deepen our comprehension of what we've built. So hopefully it can be as helpful as possible. So that's the intent. If everyone's cool, I'll just, like, get going. Lorraine, are you okay with that? Yep. Yep. So cool. Thanks for making the time, Lorraine, in the middle middle of the evening and thanks to the gang overseas for getting up late at night or early in the morning. So before we jump in, just take a second to think about the minutes that have come before and the hours that have come before and all the people and different creatures that have lived on this planet. It's a pretty gnarly thing that we live in outer space and there's been lots of people that have worked really hard to leave behind notes for us, to leave behind energy for us, to leave behind knowledge for us that have come before. So paying that deep energy backwards for a second to to all of our different ancestors um all the way back to the beginning of humans and then like back to dinosaurs and back to little goopy mycelium coming out of water and um and some explosion before that so thankful to to share a minute with you all um today as we kind of move through and i'm thankful for my own um personal bloodlines which are part of the panjang nation which go a very long way back and yeah lucky to have that that knowledge through me so um as we look back and jump into it there's a network problem that we've inherited there are when we cast a network problem back a fair distance we see significant structural challenges with our excuse one second. Yeah, when we look at the structural challenges we have, like in the short-ish history of 1,000 odd years plus, you know, 1,000 to to two thousand years, there's four to five really significant colonial empires that went about and explicitly divided the world and said, we control this and we control the wealth and we control the origins of knowledge and we control intelligence. And then all of these places that we've conquered um none of you have intelligence none of you are even human um and especially the other species like you all work for us and support our knowledge patterns and our knowledge systems and then in the last like you know couple hundred years we've had um some amalgamation of uh combinations of like emancipation of people from slavery, emancipation from like structural, systemic oppression and in lots and lots of places and spaces there's been lots of movement. And you know basically the most basic movement where people from outside the margins have then been allowed you know to knock on the door of the castle uh but if you look at the framework that we've got today there's still really really significant inherited um network bias um network inequity and and this has been intentionally designed so this is what we've inherited the the sort of like combination of the last 20 years of technology and internet um has created another really significant network problem that we've inherited where the social networks which arrived at you know we arrived in a similar time to to the major social networks around that 2005 piece was when AIM started and the social networks have really been so gnarly in how they've been able to garner such a significant bandwidth of our time and space across the earth in how we're networked so we went from being in dialogue with each other to then having a telephone radio you know can can before that and then we had a television which networked us in different ways but then we had this thing come in with the internet to connect us you know like in moments like this which are unbelievably emancipating and have great capacity for freedom of movement and then domes are put over that really quickly by these major social networks which then took our attention and started to commodify it so we have another really significant network problem that we've inherited which is our attention now is um is the commodity so you are the commodity where you look is the commodity um so before it was our actions build this whole build this um or dig this hole or you know fill in this road or build me a castle now it's like where you look um and and then where you look becomes what you think and then what you think becomes what you know so we have some really challenging network network problems for us to address and try and work through at the moment because our feedback loops are at best disjointed but you know if you were being slightly adding a slight critique to it you just kind of you can see that it's very much the tail wagging the dog of attention as much attention we can grab as possible from a human being and then alarm and anger causes more time um for attention to be mined and then the actions around that are then fed through our data which we've given away to people to then sell us stuff and that's as complex as the loop gets so between the mobile phone and the internet and the social networks in the last 20 years we've just had this like what super turbocharged funnel right into our brain and it's created a level of busyness and um and distraction where it's really hard to find that space and that capacity to connect with each other and to address the network problem that we'd inherited a couple thousand years before there's another macro challenge which has been knocking on the door in the last hundred years of a network problem and that challenge is about energy and it's about energy for humankind and energy for how we want to live and then energy to sustain our life on earth that energy resource has been mined from the earth to power light and to power technology and to power the production of food and to protect power medicine and power unbelievable advancements which have allowed us to increase life expectancy by 20 plus years and and do remarkable things in growing human potential. It's also limited the way that we've tapped our energy resource. So we're now seeing that the limits in how we've been thinking about our energy source today is got a number of consequences, which is saying the earth tip out of balance and us move into phases of more and more instability around energy and more and more instability around the impact of mining energy and what that's doing to the climate around us and to disasters and to heat and to water rising and to whole countries being swallowed. And so we have a nature problem. We have a problem with our nature and how it relates to nature and the bridge between the two being our energy relations. And that's a problem we've inherited in how we're networked. So there's sort of three major um you know train tracks that we're like looking at in this network inherited problem that play across the planet and that's what we're trying to address uh with imagination and and i think you you can address massive um seismic significant systemic problems and you can address them with massive seismic systemic solutions but you can also address them with small focused solutions and I think imagination is probably the ladder with the capacity for the former it's got in its design lots of limits and we think what we've built with imagination is we've understood the context of where we've we've come from hysterically historically excuse me um and then what we've got in front of us then gives us this roadmap to go, okay, this is where we've come from, and then where can imagination sit to be most beneficial to be a bridge between these inherited network problems and our network potential? And so that's the role of this digital country, is to bring together a collection of different people in a very unlikely fashion, which addresses network problem number one and number two, which are that we're divided and have been divided historically. And then we're even more divided now by the social networks affirming our biases and in regular regular fashion um so addressing that by creating a network of unlikely connections that allows for movement upstream so you're you're moving people to connect with people that they don't know and with knowledge that they don't know so what that starts to create is it's an attack on the attention economy it it allows you to stop the waterfall pause for a moment and then start to paddle upstream and it's a bit more effort to make those unlikely connections relationships are inefficient they take time they mean that we lose power in the short term that we create and give into a space in between where we have to say we don't know the answers and in that forging of that space in between is where really significant knowledge and wisdom lies and that provides strength and that is something that we can give on to people after we're finished it's actually yeah to know something is probably the greatest power that we have as translators as a species. So that's our network problem. 1940s, give or take, this one dude wrote a paper and he was like, oh, you know, gross domestic product was like the paper and it was like world war ii coming out of world war ii um you know we had a great depression just before that that had rocked the world and then we had a world war before that and a pandemic um in that that first half of the 20th century uh and there's echoes of some of those breakdowns and breakthroughs in the current climate and what we're looking at post pandemic. And so this one dude writes this paper and it's called Gross Domestic Product, GDP. And then within 10 years, 80-plus countries have set GDP as their impact scorecard for their whole country. One paper, 10 years, 80 countries. If we don't change what we measure, then we'll continue to have the network inheritance problem because our challenge is with what we measure and what we measure is inherited from the time when we excluded everybody except for the people in the castles in the empire. And then by not being able to expand the impact methodology, the context, the understanding and the scorecard, we then, no matter how much we expand our behaviour, no matter how much we, in civil society, we say this is good to behave this way, this is great, this is like good to be kind, you know, it's good to connect with nature, it's good to do this, unless it's on the country scorecards, then it ain't going to change so unless you change the levers at the end strategy from where intelligence starts and then the impact scorecard then it won't change and so the the the biggest significant lever that we can potentially impact with imagination by modelling it as a country, by modelling behaviours of citizens and visas and by looking at the impact through a framework different to GDP, is we can create at the very least a parallel set of measurements that can enhance the context around GDP. So if you look at GDP as, I don't know, a fist in your hand or holding your hand together, well, it might be really difficult for us to think about how we could just eradicate that and pull that out. But you could grow its context and you could have gross relational potential sit as part of the GDP and it could expand the relational impact and you could have that health and that well-being and that nature score and the bioregional health could expand and the trading routes within it, you can tweak and move the measurements around. So if the frame doesn't work, you can play within the frame and there is a really strong argument, you know, it's a very different context to what it was in 1940\. We're not running production lines and we're not trying to sell as many cars as humanly possible, as much oil as humanly possible. It's not expansion. There's a very, very different context. So you might say perhaps there is time for nation states to have a very different measurement system to match the context and set us up for the next 100 years. Gross relational potential is our way of trying to look in and measure the value of the space in between each node in a network. So between two humans, what is the energy current that moves between those two humans? What is that worth and when people are depressed when societies are depressed when human energy is down what is the cost of human energy being down not to productivity so you buy a product what happens when the human spirit is down when energy is down and what happens when the human spirit is up when energy is up what happens to our capacity to be able to move to relate to each other so if you are alone in a town somewhere in the world, in remote South Africa, and you are in a community like Venda, and you are someone like Vitali Nwamondo, who just passed away this year, who worked with us for close to a decade. When Vitali's energy is up, he has social mobility. He can create relationships with people. He can lift the energy currents in a town and he can create movement. So that is what we are really interested in, is the relationships between human beings and how that energy moves and what that potential can look like. And in a balance sheet at the moment, that might be called the in-kind ledger in corporate governance. So what does the in-kind look like? So when you don't start with money but you start with relations, what does that look like? The second part that we're really interested in is the relational potential between human beings and other species. There's, I think it's $800 billion the nature repair market's been costed at by the World Economic Forum. That's, you know, at best a low score. There's 1.25 trillion, which is another number that's been said is a nature-centred economy. The reality is like every single thing that we sell, every single piece of clothing, the computers, everything is nature-centred. Everything's from nature. Everything's from the earth. Everything has been created within the container of earth. We have not left earth and collected anything to come back and make stuff even though that's on the agenda now to go and mine in our in outer space um but we haven't done that yet so everything is from this one resource this one planetary resource the challenge again with our measurement systems is by excluding the value of 7 million other species, it means we can have more profit margin. So if it's called, if it's not called cow, but it's called steak, if it's called computer, not raw minerals from a community of beautiful people with 20 000 years of knowledge and history and those raw minerals are connected to story and knowledge if it's just called computer of course it's easier for us to be detached from it and when we live in cities and we live in buildings and we never see the actual understory then it's much harder for us to be connected to the reality of where all of the things that we occupy our time with all the stuff comes from so that we're not going to i don't think we're going to get out of this like um capitalism puzzle like in a minute uh and we may not ever get out of it but the opportunity here is looking at what does it look like now to have a much healthier set of orientations where we acknowledge that everything has come from the natural world and that everything goes back into these trash heaps, which is what's causing so much of the damage to our climate. So if we can acknowledge it and address it, then what do we do with it? And that's where I think the potential energy that's untapped is really significant for us as a species. There's 7 million other species we have yet to build deep mainstream formal relationships with. And the same relationships that we adhere and look up to human beings around where we say that person is a knowledge holder and we value that knowledge holder, as the same we can do with other species. Not with humans as the most powerful, but with humans orienting and understanding our role as custodians, being in relation to every other species. And so that requires a shift for human beings in our orientation, which again is something that imagination works on, how to orient and connect people to be able to have that potential to move and. There are two prizes, the potential and the relational potential between human beings and each other, and the potential and relational potential between human beings and other species. And that's what we're looking at with gross relational potential. We don't know how to do it. We don't know how to measure it all. But we're starting with putting a flag down and saying, by the end of the decade, we're hopeful we have a methodology that we can hand on the nation states. And just as one person wrote a paper in the 1940s and it was adopted 10 years later by 80 plus countries, we're saying we think there is value in these two specific streams of energy between human beings and how we measure that value and the energy between human beings and other species. And we're gonna get that onto different forms of ledgers and in the different processes and protocols we can move. So imagination is like, so whatever, whatever it means in terms of context and stuff like this isn't said to be competitive or to win awards or to get glory it's just more to set context we there's we talk to our knowledge and what we've seen imagination is the first network state built into the internet with governance and with structures around it with an economy and with the capacity to move so to our understanding it's the first nation that's been built into the internet with the capacity to be able to apply governance through behavior in trade outcomes and then to move and there's a couple of really fascinating people doing really interesting stuff in this space as well um and yeah whether we're first or third or fifth or whatever it's um it's a significant design leap for humankind to think about what does it mean to build countries into the internet what does it mean to build countries into the internet the second part is to our knowledge it's one of the first if not the first relational network as an alternative to the social networks so there just my dad calling that I'm just doing I am just talking about imagination to heaps of people. Can I call you back later? Thanks, Dad. Apologies. I miss turning my phone off and dropping children at school and running around and so on. So the next, yeah, when we set imagination in that context as an alternative to the social networks, it's very easy to tear things down. It's very easy to look at the social networks and to say there are flaws here. And I didn't want us as a group of people to just be critics but to be builders and engineers and designers and to understand the network challenges but then to go and build it. And we have built an alternative offering for how to organise people to relate and come together, which has a very different set of principles to what the major social networks have been built on and have continued to grow from. So inside imagination imagination we're not interested in anyone's data there's no advertising um we're not pushing notifications we're actually setting barriers to entry um where we're creating walls outside to ask people not to come into imagination um and then if they do come in, that they're explicitly focused on the work they're doing outside in the world, that this is a network to hack the networking challenge that we have of being connected to who we know and what we know and to create spaces for trade and for credit ratings for that behaviour and to start to get on the ledger some of these challenges we have around how we relate to each other and how we value those relations and then how we relate to nature. So yeah, in terms of context, in 2025 I think it's the first relational network. It's definitely the first digital country relational network that's powered by an economy that has hoodies as its centre token. So I definitely know that. It's definitely the first country that has built a governance system around puppets leading through diversity inside of this digital country. of this digital country. So we have professors, which are puppets for us, that will be the key governance shareholders inside Imagination that allow us to not be heroes with the knowledge that we get gifted to us through this experience, but to then pass it on into books that live inside this long research project through Imagination University. So all of the collective projects inside Imagination pass it on into books that move inside this long research project through imagination university so all of the collective projects inside imagination are looking to unpack the how-to and the processes and the journeys that people go through we're not interested in just like holding up the hero journey and chucking someone on the stage we want to unpack how do we do it so we can leave a trail of of paths behind or we leave trails on the path behind so people then have a route and they have a map to move into the future. Imagination is all open source. Anyone that wants to code can take it tomorrow and build their own version of imagination and it's our hope that there will be many versions of imaginations of it in the coming years and definitely after our death date. We have set an intentional death date for imagination. We see this country as being in context relation to every nation on planet earth at the moment and to the nations that we need tomorrow. So we've set ourselves a 10 year lifespan of which the first two years have not seen anyone inside imagination at scale. It's been focused on building the governance and the protocols and the processes. So we've moved to an embassy for two years around the world. And before that, I've lived in an embassy for 18 years. And it's my hope that people that go into building digital networks in the future spend at least 20 years in the field with scar tissue of knowing people before they start to play god in the internet so yeah imagination is is specific time focus and a bridge hopefully between the nation states of today to where we need to get to tomorrow by bringing together a coalition of the different system change leaders needed to to power this impact and to move that across the board so I'll talk to the who's in it in a minute but that's sort of the context for where imagination sits in the current landscape so the change logic of imagination for us is for the people coming into imagination, as we look at that network problem we've inherited and the pathway towards gross relational potential and to deliver the promise of this alternative to the social networks and to really build that digital nation state that we can uphold as a case study and move with. And we had to look at the key areas where we could be the most helpful in shifting the logic inside of human beings so we can then relate more effectively to each other and to other species. So our change logic focuses on nine key pathways for people. The first one is the default settings inside of us. So most tech builders will probably not tell you that all their focus, a lot of their focus is on affirming the default settings that they want you to carry on. So they'll build into their products some locked-in default settings into the phones. They'll build that into applications, into browsers. And so it creates, after 20 times of engaging with that, it creates a set of patterns that are very, very difficult to unpick. So to shift your browser setting to another browser, it takes you 20 times to go and use another browser before you're cognitively starting to actually break free from the default browser that was built into your computer or to your phone. So the default settings have been dialed up more and more and played with more and more as tech got closer and closer to us and inside our pockets you know inside our ears talking into our brain and so what we wanted to do was create a level of awareness and support for people to to look at their default settings of where they were oriented relationally right now and to have that capacity to zoom out and to look at it and to to be open and transparent with where we're at and then to have through the journey and imagination over the course of the 12 months the chance to engage in a number of different movements that will hopefully by the end of the journey see a shift at the very least in awareness of the default settings but potentially where the default settings are into the future is the intention. So that's the first piece that we're focusing on the second one is addressing the orientation of where we are oriented again I mentioned at the start but where our attention goes then drives our our attention drives how we think which drives what we know which then drives what we value drives where our money know which then drives what we value drives where our money goes and then that sort of intersection keeps moving so we're looking at just providing a space for um for bringing in a number of our indigenous knowledge systems to just help map um how we're oriented and that's like been super complex to translate but when it comes out the other end it's not that complex like it's just that we have a relationship with a species from the past from the future from today with an imaginary creature and with a species that's not human that we're carrying with us and if we have those four or five around us then we're oriented in a healthier way. We're thinking collectively in terms of our social contractors expanded from just affirming the group of people that are really close to us that are like us. So there's quite a few pathways that we're focusing on relational reorientation. And that's the anchor point that keeps bringing us back together once a month as we gather in a club of unlikely connections. All the citizens inside Imagination together once a month as we gather in a club of unlikely connections. All the citizens inside Imagination gather once a month. And there's a key theme around relational orientation that we focus on for that month. And then design. We can feel very powerless when we feel like we're just at the end of a production line and that we have no capacity to be able to design the future that the best thing we can do is rebel by screaming and trying to tear down the production line but the idea that we can actually get to the start of it and design it differently is often not given to us as as a thought let alone as a set of tools and processes that we can apply. If you are a systems designer, everything is always in context. You can design across any field, anywhere, anytime. If you're a systems designer, you therefore have capacity to tap into any budget, anywhere, anytime. If you get your knowledge patterns to position at the start of the design queue, then you have power. You have the ability to move with and around the people who have inherited the castles, who are working out how to build the bridges between the castles and the world that we're in tomorrow. So applying systems design is almost impossible in isolation. And this is where the hero's journey of what we've inherited from some of our major popular culture narratives that have disseminated around the world in the last century or so. The hero's journey doesn't serve you in systems design. It can't because you can't hold the whole map of the earth in your head you can only hold a puzzle piece of as much as what you can know and then you can have a collective imagination in the middle where you understand that other people know things and that imagination allows you to to cast your mind beyond your puzzle piece and to get a sense of the map. And then systems design works when you're relationally healthy and you have a relational network that can move together. So when you're looking around, you see all the puzzle pieces moving and oscillating. And I think that's where sort of self-governance or distributed leadership sort of significantly comes into play when you can apply systems design to systems action and focus on on where you're oriented in that that puzzling together which is the the then translation into the next phase on action so this is a network it's not a passive network so it's not a network just to come in and just learn or just come in and hang out. Everyone here is intentionally here to lead systemic change for the planet. And again, I'll talk through the key groups that we're releasing visas to for the first three to four years in imagination. But yeah, it's focused on action. It's focused on on serious practical action taking um some of the the biggest theories and challenges from inside and outside the margins and then applying it um and finding those case studies so we can shift our economies if we don't move the money then there's no point doing any of this work um so this action is trying to orient the all the way through to the bottom line so we actually have case studies around gross relational potential through to GDP and case studies that can move us to where we need to get to. There is space for wandering around and we're not going to measure that space, but we've got some gifts for people inside of. There's a cinema that you can go and watch and feature films that have bubbled up inside this network over the last 20 years and we're not going to put thousands of thousands of thousands of films so you're there in some never-ending hole of attention when you have to go and do the washing or sleep or get some water so the the focus will just be some really high curated couple of texts you know three to five texts in each area so you don't get overwhelmed but hopefully there's something helpful if you've got some space for wandering and then you can go and take that text and make sense in the world yourself and fill in the gaps we don't want to be the only group that you ever learn from the tools um that we're we're going to be focused on is that each body of work is contributing to a collective set of tools. One of my favourite designs on the internet is Wikipedia, so we're unashamedly borrowing from that in creating co-created books for everybody to then leave that behind as to how you make a JoyCorp or how you make an Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab with each case study contributing to it. It's another thing that I think stanford and harvard have done well in their business school model is case study teaching and it's a strong practice to pass on knowledge for us when we see the actual story in action and learning through story has been something that's been significant for indigenous people forever so the tools will be focused on shaping into books into films um into you know imagination as a tool in and of itself, things that can be picked up and carried on after our death date. So we're intentionally, by facing our death as a network, we're intentionally understanding that the tools are the things that shape everything into the future, and if we can leave behind these tools, that will be our greatest legacy. tools, that will be our greatest legacy. The capital, so the attack on our lack of valuation for relational health with each other is to create a parallel credit system and create reputational credits through tokens. And the tokens are the hoodies. And that's existed already, every university or school, if you've ever had a child or been a child, you get a certificate that is a credit. That's someone giving you a credit rating inside their system. So being able to work with that trading route, we've created passports, and then people will get credits, digital hoodies and then be able to ladder up to physical hoodies which will give them capital inside imagination. It'll also give them capital outside. So another modern form of using knowledge as capital has been the CV which LinkedIn has also used really well as a way of connecting people and moving people to trade together. So we'll be creating this capital inside this network, which then a young person who goes and is an imagination president for a year and restarts custodial economics in India or Australia or remote continent of Africa, they will then have the capacity to take that work and go and get employment in their own ecosystem and use that as a CV trading route. The next bit we're going to offer inside Imagination is we're actually going to offer some trading capabilities, but only once people have done the first seven fields. So unless you've done the work, you don't get access to the club. And the club will be accessed at the end of people's work at the end of the 12 months and part of the governance will be that the group of four unlikely people that that everyone is matched together with so in in their unlikely connections of five will contribute to deciding whether the work has been done by each person so they'll contribute to the peer accreditation, which we borrowed from academia, which we think is a really healthy accreditation pathway is having that peer accreditation. And it prevents that gamification. And it means that then whoever gets into that trading playground, gets access to exchange jobs, opportunities, experiences and knowledge. So we'll have mentoring opportunities for people. We've had relationships with people like Dr. Jane Goodall and other fancy knowledge holders and people you might not know of who are also fancy knowledge holders and being able to have one-on-one coaching sessions with them. We'll be working with other groups to provide opportunities for experiences like housing or transportation and movement for the embassy. And then there'll be a chance for jobs and trade and exchange in between. And, hey, I'm traveling over to your country. Can I stay with you? Yes, like, et cetera, et cetera. That group that can trade inside Imagination, that meeting place will be accessible for the full lifespan of imagination for their eight years and that will grow to about 5 000 people that will be able to trade inside of that trusted relational network who will all have different embassy points around the world so if you think of like a flight map around planet earth there'll be all these plot points of people that have um gained their capital and relational capital inside imagination and then we will hand over a message a address book at the end of the eight years so you'll have a forever you know address book of these people that you can then pass on to your families um for generation after generation after generation so the relationships don't disappear um and you can pick up the phone and call someone in this trusted network hopefully hopefully many generations afterwards, and be like, hey, my grandfather Lorian was in imagination. I'm in Australia. I was wondering if we could catch up. Yeah, cool, let's catch up. So the trust is hopefully reinstated. The same trust that drives our Indigenous systems is what we're hoping to make sure by going through this significant body of work is our version and our nod of ceremony in and doing deep ceremony so that people have actually, when we look around, we know that they've done the work and that they're trustworthy. And then in that work, when that is created, then you can practise this network behaviour where you give it away to keep it. And when you give into a network, you know, it's not a waste of time and you're not expecting anything in return because, you know, it's going to keep moving around. And when you need something, but the people that we're working with inside the network we think have the capacity to influence up to 8 billion people plus. And so, yes, this small club will hopefully hold a parallel set of safety for humankind as we're trying to navigate the breakdown of a number of systems around us. I'm just going to have a sip of my mate. Thanks, Alejandro, for the mate. He's on the plane. And then the last one, oh, there he is. Then there's CoLab. Is the final legacy of imagination? If there's one thing that's um again never don't trust someone too much who can speak in one things but i think i can at the moment so don't trust me wholeheartedly um the the collab piece is the missing piece for us as a species we've lost our ability to talk to each other and we've lost our ability to talk to other species so we need to codify that we need to codify how do we collaborate with each other again how do we have discourse how do we have debate how do we have conflict how do we understand how to misunderstand and how do we create a level of complexity into our discourse so we can reclaim attention we can reclaim space So we can reclaim attention, we can reclaim space, and we have space to think. We have space to not know. We have space for growth. And none of that space exists at the moment with the way we've been networked. And so there's no surprise to me that in talking about this work for the last two to three years that often people are frustrated when receiving it because they have no time to think. And so you're creating some level of complexity with something that's already full. What we need to help each other do is create a set of protocols again where we can collaborate. And I mean again because there have been lots of times when we've had space as a species and been able to collaborate with each other and with other species. Lots of our Indigenous systems have done that really well with other species and created healthy trading routes and reclaimed space and time. And we have a very, very gnarly, like, you know, these phones and the devices and the technology we're working with create a set of contexts which are much more intense than a lot that we've faced. And we've survived ice ages. So we've also survived some intense things before. So I think it's just there is some serious, intense context and we need to work out how to recover that space in between. If one of our few legacies in the nine years is we create a co-lab book of processes and protocols for humankind, how broadly the space of non-Indigenous people communicate with Indigenous people and in design and in systems design, then that will be a huge legacy. If we create that CoLab book that helps human beings understand how to be custodians and communicate with other species, that will be a huge legacy. And if we can help human beings reclaim the space to communicate with each other in healthy ways through complexity, that will be a huge legacy. So that's our, there's a number of books we're creating and a number of tools, but our eye on that CoLab tool, that'll be our 150th tool, that'll be the last thing that we publish, because that's the hardest prize for us, how to talk to each other and how to talk to other species. We're going to call if we keep going? Sweet. The key people inside Imagination, we're focused on 5,000 Action Visa holders. So five different groups that we've selected, 5,000 people that we think can influence 10,000 people each. Does anyone know what 5,000 times 10,000 is? Can you do it in your head? So 5,000 people that can influence 10,000, sorry, influence is not the right word, that can impact 10,000 people in their lifetime is who we're looking at that have the potential to do that. This isn't someone that necessarily has to be established as that person already. And a lot of people pushed outside the margins don't have that impact potential, don't have that influence right now, that network influence because of what they've inherited. So we're going to give them that network power. That's what imagination is. We're going to give them that ability to reach 10,000 people if they need to, to have that power and that platform to take the knowledge that's important and then to shift and move people around them. So what was the number? Did anyone end up with a number? Is it 50 mil? 50 million. 50 mil. Numbers go. So 50 million people impacted through the action visas. And that's just the legacy effect of the bodies of work. That's not actually the action that's happening inside of it. This is just what these people will do after they complete this level of action so a joy corp has its own isolated impact inside of it so there's one joy there's a thousand joy corps will be accrediting accrediting over the next eight years one joy corp has the capacity to influence depending at the size of it if it has 40 000 employees and a customer base of a million people it can influence at least a million people but it can influence the whole nation state it could influence the whole way organizations move it could move the dial on grp and have that moving you know in really significant ways really quickly so there's there's upside just in the 5000 alone in the action points, which could potentially have impact across ranging up to billions of people and reaching millions of species just through those action points, through schools, through citizens, through organisations, through Indigenous knowledge systems labs, and then through young people re-establishing custodial economies and moving that. So 5,000 is our focus or one of our four focuses. 150 are the number of tools we'll be making. So we've formed Imagination Studios, we'll form Imagination Books this year and we'll be a publishing house that can shape these tools and be able to distribute them so those tools will include the processes and protocols so something like unc5 which is the algorithm that we've built this thing off um that is a tool that we will share with people the ability to connect in unlikely connections of five and build the academic papers and then you can take those tools and implement it into your workplace or your school or your home or your sporting team or whatever. 130 is the number of systems change residents we're going to incubate and support and give their ability for their earthshot projects to then have support around tool creation so they can then move the communication of what they're working on and to move that at scale. So those 130 will experience a system change physical residency in Australia and then we'll support them with the creation of tools to help communicate this complexity of big ideas so it can get back into the existing system and move the capital and behavior and create the movement that they need around them. So an example of one of these that we supported last year in our first year of piloting this was Heliogenesis which is a project that Thomas is working on out of Germany and the premise of Heliogenesis is I think the sun working on out of Germany and the premise of Heliogenesis is I think the Sun hits us every day, hits the Earth and a thousand times the power that we need for all human life on Earth, a thousand times what we need each day is what the Sun provides. So a thousand times our capacity already is what the Sun provides. And at best we know how to you know with all of our technological interventions that are planned and ahead of us maybe capture three to five percent of that potential power and thomas's theory of change or premise is that well we we don't know how to do that but plants do and they do that with photosynthesis every single day so he wants to look at how by tapping into the plant network that can power life on Earth, that the plant becomes a conductor to move the energy from the sun through. And, you know, he solves that, then maybe that's our energy problem solved. So that's an example of one of the 130 Earthshot projects we'll be incubating and supporting. And then 50 will be the number of embassy big stories that we tell and these are um happenings and a chance for us to go and to um there's been research that's come out that when when the ground is stomped um with dance and with drumming that it actually wakes up the mycelium, which then is a signal that it's time to start growing. So ceremonial dance and song is not for show. It's farming. It's growing the earth and it's creating vibrations that can move. We're going to create those vibrations in 50 cities and towns around the world so that towns can regrow and move. We're going to create those vibrations in 50 cities and towns around the world so that towns can regrow and move again. And we'll do that through an immersive big story, through us moving as a troop, a caravan of clowns. We were coined by Bruce Pascoe, who's a brilliant Australian Indigenous thinker who we visited last year. And we will go to places where the knowledge holders are and who are fatiguing and we will give them energy back and we'll go into the places where well and truly inside the castle walls where they're fatiguing and they need energy and they need imagination to work out how to get to where we need to get to collectively So 5,000 action visas, 1,000 Joy corporations who are moving the balance sheet. So the focus on Joy Corp again through the lever has been to create a cousin or a sister or an auntie or a niece or a nephew to Joy to B Corp what already exists, and then to create not just a set of accounting measurements but a roadmap. So there's 70-odd roadmaps that we've provided for people to navigate with Joy Corporations, and that will help them reorient themselves relationally. So it's not just saying change the impact scorecard. We can't just do that and then leave people alone. The challenge is all the river runs that run into that experience, all the roads that lead into those castles. So the Joy Corporation will have a chance to do that. And one example of one of those outcomes is being able to create mentoring experiences with all their officers for the most marginal communities and schools around them and Mobilizing their workforce to be responsible for the kids that are being left behind That's one of the 70 odd Indigenous knowledge systems labs been lucky enough to be a part of helping set up the first indigenous knowledge systems labs with Tyson younger Porter and the first Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs with Tyson Yunkaporta and Dr John Davis and Pachels Marshall and Dr Jody Edwards and Joshi Waters and a collection of associates. The key play with Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs is to bring Indigenous knowledge systems to the start of the design queue and not have us bottom feeding at the end of the economy on survival and being seen as a problem to be fixed. Of course there are problems because of what we've inherited from the last two centuries. So we need to be able to get our designers to the start of the design queue before we start shaping the rules and containers that don't allow for health and wealth for everybody. The three other parties are young people, so there'll be 1,000 young people as imagined presidents with a focus as much as possible on young Indigenous people having the chance to re-establish custodial economies. So in this macro $800 billion nature repair market, we need case studies of the dollars moving to nature and centering nature. We need case studies of intelligent relations with nature and we need to be able to create different systems where that can move. We don't know the answers for all of those, but we want to create a marketplace for it where these thousand people can be the... Jack, I think you just got muted. Jack, I think you just got muted. Yeah, so from a generation of young people who've had to protest to a generation of young people who can then have some slither of hope to go, okay, if I can prove this case study, then this network will help take this case study to the World Economic Forum and then work with governments to create measurement systems and incentives to then move these nature-centered economies through their systems and Joy Corps are doing it and other people are doing it so maybe I'm not alone and maybe I can do this if I'm one of the you know climate leaders that have led the protest maybe I can be the one that shapes the custodial economies we need in micro and macroeconomic fashion so there'll be a thousand of those that we're supporting over the course of the next eight years. There'll be a thousand of schools with a focus on our most marginal schools, marginalized schools around the world, to have the chance to become imagination labs and trade in real time, to be havens of like custodial economics and micro playgrounds. If you think MIT Media Labs, if you know that reference, think of that in schools around the world with a focus on custodianship and imagination being unleashed. No question that imagination is our single greatest knowledge source and there's no question that the last couple of hundred years in schools we've done our best to beat it out of what we're doing because we've created production lines and schools for production lines it doesn't fit what we need tomorrow which is uncertainty it worked for the last hundred years in different ways it didn't work for lots of people the structures are still helpful to obtain you know mathematics and english and there's a bunch of things we still need but we need context and we need the ability to be reoriented and young people need to be able to understand how to take on complexity and we are not setting them up for that in any of our networks and any of our schooling so being able to create these imagination labs empowers schools to go you're not a problem trade now get a contract with nasa because look look out there over the horizon from your school exams and no one has any idea what to do in the next century. The only people who are pretending are the ones that are tearing things down. No one has a plan. So you've got to be the generation to help make plans together. There ain't a roadmap anymore. So we have to work out how to adventure together. we have to work out how to adventure together. Then the last group, so we've got Joy Corps, Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs, and then we've got Young People Re-establishing Custodial Economies, Schools Trading as Imagination Labs. And then the final group is for people that want to work on change to be able to, of doing that in isolation to take on a systems change framework to how you apply change and the myth of the entrepreneur um being everything is uh is at best very significant wasted human potential to be be able to move at a systemic level and not in an isolated fashion where you're a hero, to be able to not chase glory where your company wins everything or your idea wins everything, to actually see your role in creating change and being relation to every other organisation, to not compete but to to cooperate to understand that you don't know everything and then from those bases and frameworks to design interventions only because it is necessary not because you need a legacy or you're bored so to analyze understand your role and your role might be if you're bored. So to analyse, understand your role, and your role might be if you're a systems change citizen to support someone else. I would love to go and work for someone else. I would love to. I would love someone else to have built my imagination. But if there is a role there and you have found a proper systemic lever that is missing, then pull that hard and pull that with systems thinking and pull that in relation to everybody else so you have the best chance to access the knowledge that's necessary for it and you don't create some surface level intervention which is potentially going to do more harm than good it's going to be crappy scaffolding over buildings that are falling down and you're going to waste energy and movement and we can't waste energy and movement when everything's in relation when you see it from a systems change view, everything's in context, nothing's wasted. Any failure or any effort into a place which you didn't see before, if you've understood and acknowledged that context that you can't see everything, then everything becomes an exploration. And if you come back and you share those tools in relation, then you're healthy. So we'll help with passing on some of those frameworks and methodologies for how to move as a systems change citizen and then how to apply that to the project that you're working on and that'll be the focus for the 5000\. i'll just say on the 5000 just quickly that um I'll just say on the 5,000 just quickly that there's also big limits to the growth. So we're focused on increasing at the rate of relations with rolling out the visas. So we're not going to do 5,000 in one go. This year we're starting with 15 visas and we've mapped this alongside Dunbar's work, which I'll talk to to in the governance section so we've looked at robin dunbar and how to how many relations we can actually hold of value and then we've mapped that with indigenous kinship models as well so we've got a slow increase and then for the first 15 that come through there's an opportunity to then bring another 15 with you so it will mean that hopefully there's not a huge emphasis needed on like marketing this thing that we can just have a healthy relational word of mouth that when you have an opportunity you can pass on to someone else once you've come through and then that should mean that we reach the 5000 if we if we just approach um a process of unlikely connections and how we're feeling the gaps behind us so we're not always filling it with people like us unlikely connections in how we're filling the gaps behind us so we're not always filling it with people like us but we think that over the last 20 years we've created a strong enough unlikely connection core nucleus inside the governance group that's driving this that if we just play out from who we know now that the tendrils are moving in such a way that it's going to be unlikely because the core nucleus is very unlikely so, that'll be our pathway to the 5000\. The 130 residents, yeah, they'll have one week in Australia as part of an overarching process that we're looking at and shaping into a big story called the Lost Labs, where they'll get to come and have a connection with an Indigenous knowledge systems holder on land and an on-land lab and bring their problem that they're trying to solve onto the land with some of the longest continuous labs on planet Earth. And then we'll be creating imagination immersions to unlock that imagination and then connection to custodianship experiences and to mentoring knowledge. We'll then develop tools that can help for that group to go and translate and disseminate and move that knowledge around as well. The 50 locations, this is an open combination invitation for people that we're working with and for what emerges. Wherever we can be most helpful to unlock the human spirit and the human heart and to unlock and fight fiercely for hope with people to make the ground move and shake and regrow, then we'll bring our collective storytelling might and combine with people on the ground move and shake and regrow, then we'll bring our collective storytelling might and combine with people on the ground to wake us up so we can do the work that's necessary. And then the 150 tools have the capacity to reach every human being on earth now and then into the future. So these will be focused on unlocking universal imagination, mentoring and custodianship for humankind. One example of a tool we're working on right now is the Professor's TV series, which is documenting a fight for hope and a battle between humanity and our imagination, which will be an eight-year series that will be available for everybody to be able to watch for free around the world on Imagination TV, which is a streaming platform we're setting up as well. So, yeah, that's one of the tools that we'll be releasing in the next 12 months. The governance of the work has been built around three collective circles or grown through three collective circles, grown through a 20-year network as a second way that we built the governance, and then grown through some peer-to-peer mapping systems and utilising kinship mapping with Rob and Dunbar's work. So the first three big circles are that we're in imagination, we're for universal imagination for humankind, universal mentoring for humankind and universal custodianship. So we're working towards those three circles of which we have guides inside and outside Ames University that can support with that. We have an imagination circle that we've helped establish outside of Paris with a crew called Learning Planet. And then we have the professors that we've started to embody as an organisation. So the professors are the puppets that we work with. So I'm not sure if our team has puppets floating around, but they often join meetings and jump in and help us consistently have imagination personified and connected to us. And then as a team, we've taken on very much as a core nucleus that art leads that intelligence. And so we've got an imagination gallery that we paint in every week. And by having that connection and that relationship and orientation back to imagination, we get a chance to access the highest intelligence and make sure that we can govern imagination effectively. The second circle is custodianship. So we've got the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs that help govern imagination and help with a lot of the design. And then we have a collection of Indigenous knowledge holders in Australia and around the world that are helping shepherd and support us. And we move the embassy back in relation to the country with them to make sure that we're creating those positive feedback loops. And we've created a return to the water shareholder experience where we go underwater as an ecosystem with our team all around the world. And then in Australia, we go to the east coast of Australia to help reforest a coastline and have a sunrise ceremony once a month. So we've built those governance models into what we're doing. And then on mentoring, we have 20 years of mentoring knowledge embedded in the organisation. Mentor mindsets, values, behaviours embedded into how we work and that supports our governance and it also supports the governance inside imagination. And then we have mentors and residents that we can dial up or dial down if we need extra support, and a board of directors in Australia, and then a board of directors in America that help with that governance as well. The second big ecosystem is AIM. So AIM is responsible for Imagination. So we're putting our hand up and saying we're responsible. We'll be responsible if something goes wrong and i'm the ceo of the joint for now and um hopefully can hang around for a while and so i'll ultimately be responsible if something goes wrong inside the network if harm is caused um which we're doing our best to build the system around not being able to do that but if something goes wrong and and someone gets hurt that'll be on me and on our team and we'll accept responsibility in trying to address that as healthily as we can and moving forward. We have a group of about 35 staff that are on full time and supporting the network. And then our job as a group has been to make sure that we have that capacity to be able to be that network support for everybody. And then the broader ecosystem that we're building around us now, so we've been looking at, which is the third bucket, this Robin Dunbar work around how Dunbar meets kinship, and I'll come back to bucket number two. So Robin Dunbar is one of 12 people in the world that's had a number named after him. He's done this research into some key numbers, which you'll see moving through what we're doing. The 150 is the number of relations that any society can hold at depth for strength. And then 5,000 is the limit of the number of names that you can remember or faces you can remember. Apologies. And then there's a set of numbers that Robin has looked at and researched. So 5, 15, 35, 50, 150, I think, are the way they ladder up. And again, I can adjust that if I get that wrong in the chat. So we've built our governance around that. So we have five that are sort of our core groups that will gather around leadership when needed, and that will change. We have the UNC5 which is where Dunbar's met kinship. So we put people into imagination in a group of unlikely connections of five. There's not a hero page just by yourself. You're not alone in imagination and that group of four unlikely connections, that gathering of five of you, gives you your core nucleus and it then creates a parallel nucleus alongside what you've inherited with your family or friends. And then we're trying to grow your network up and or out, whatever is the right healthiest phrase of growth, up to 150\. So that can sit alongside the parallel network of what you've inherited from the social networks and from generations before. So relationships with other species, with other texts, as you make your way up to 150\. Our role with governance and how we're looking to apply the Dunbar work is realizing that 35 of us, even if we're extraordinary inside of AIM, cannot govern this thing alone. So it's why we've set it up to be a network of networks. So all of these pieces like the Joy Corporation or Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs were built for what already exists. So we're bringing in custodians of the network and they will have 150 custodians each year that will have a custodian ship hoodie and be connected to being responsible and say they are responsible for one specific part of the network. So it won't necessarily, when something goes wrong, I'll definitely put my hand up, but I'm hoping there'll be 149 people alongside me that'll say, yeah, I was also responsible for that and we missed that. So you'll be able to see a proper coalition of shared leadership and responsibility, not just your traditional kind of CEO hiding away in some office somewhere being a sociopath. Did I say that? Okay, cool. So that's how we're looking at the governance and the kinship work for us and how those 150 custodians will then help with the health and responsibility of the network each year um yeah which leads into the next bit so what do the custodians get we give them a hoodie um and then we built this network so yeah that hoodie is our credit system it's our way of connecting different levels and behavior and we've seen it before with the scouts which have traveled all around the world or we've seen it with the army with different accreditations ratings that you get on clothing. These hoodies will be specific for each person's outcomes. There's digital hoodies for your micro achievements and then there's physical hoodies that can be unlocked for getting to certain levels. And that custodian ship hoodie is hopefully a key, a credit, a soul piece. But also, yeah, when moving around the world, if someone spots a custodianship hoodie is hopefully a key, you know, a credit, a soul piece. But also, yeah, when moving around the world, if someone spots a custodian hoodie somewhere, they know that they've done the work. And if that's handed on to your daughter or son or niece or nephew, that's something more powerful, I think, or as powerful as any of the major pieces of clothing that have existed in sporting clubs and been turned into these hero worship kind of pieces so we hope that those 150 custodian hoodies are really really powerful signifiers and and tools for people to move so yeah the cool thing about, how we've mapped the hooded economy is, a cool thing, can I say it's a cool thing? Yeah, maybe I can. Word count's getting up, so I can maybe miss one or two words, if we're using what we've already got. So one of the most horrifying things about fashion and about clothing and about where we've got to is we don't actually need to make any new clothes. There's enough clothes in rubbish tips. If we just worked out how to cycle them back through if we really wanted to keep buying something again and again and again so we've got about 20 000 hoodies in storage um over the last 20 years we've aim had hoodies and lots of different versions of hoodies we feel very confident that we can deliver the stimulus needed inside imagination with physical hoodies with at most 7,000 to 8,000 of those hoodies, which means we still have 13,000 that we can activate in embassy and move around in different ways. And what will make those special will be the human touch. So we'll have a certificate that makes that an official hoodie for you, but then we're going to have people that come together when they come out in embassy in Australia, and we're going to to make them by hand we're going to adorn them by hand so when our team travels to australia once a year we're going to work on these hoodies and we're going to put the badges for the people that do the work on the hoodies and it'll be touched by human beings who value the work who get to understand through the hoodie the relationships with what other people are doing so it won't be just one person hidden away in a production line. Again, like it will be felt and touched not by experts but by human beings. So these hoodies will be relationally made, relationally credited and relationally gifted so that energy can carry on. And then the impact, the really significant prize is if we don't move any dollars on the way to that $800 billion nature repair market, then we've failed. And we've failed at our ability to meet the challenge of our times which is to work out how to create economies that value and center nature it doesn't mean there'll be a bunch of other things that don't have value but that's the prize the prize is we need to get onto the ledger measurement systems that expand GDP to gross relational potential and beyond we need to be able to showcase how to be networked in healthier ways and shift the piping inside our organisations and schools, inside the way we think about creating change, inside civil society. We need to reward and incentivise impact that looks at increasing the energy between human beings and the energy between human beings and other species. And then we need to be able to create measurement tools that can do that. So we've created a message stick with the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs and with Tyson Yunkaporta, which is an Indigenous carved measurement system. And what we're looking to do with that is open source that over the course of the next 12 months months but definitely over the course of the next eight years so you'll be able to type data into an into a spreadsheet online and then that data will then illuminate into the message stick so what we're hoping to create is a series of impact measurement systems that re-expand the context so we can measure what matters not just what we understand how to measure but we can measure and look into things that we don't understand and create that space for growth and value beyond what the current human mind knows and beyond definitely what we've inherited in our measurement patterns. So that impact will happen. We've also got to, in terms of measuring this work, we have a hoodie stock exchange, which will be updating the value of each individual project so you'll be able to track the Joy Corp hoodie which will all be added up from people's behaviours. You'll be able to track the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs hoodie. So that's just project-based like look at you know Kickstarter or one of these other areas where you can track a variety of projects in real time or Asana or whatnot. And then we'll also have a television show that provides context once every four months called Lightning, which will just share some of the more narrative based impacts of what's going on, the qualitative stuff that you might not be able to capture in the numbers through the message stick or through the Hody Stock Exchange. So that's the way that we'll report back. We'll also be able to, yeah, they're the three areas that we'll report back on impact. The other part that we'll be working on inside the Imagination University will be ongoing research, which we'll point to in our impact work in Lightning and we'll highlight that. But that fits into tools and into the 150 tools will be the research that we're leaving behind. And that's the body of work so that's what we're looking to leave behind at the end of the eight years is a forever network and trading routes of relational exchange that can carry on a humankind well into the future you leave that. And that's, yeah, we'll go to the next one, thanks. So our focus on imagination is to take the network problem into network potential. And that's the end of the presentation. I'm happy to take some questions if you want to, if anyone's got any questions or comments um beautiful jack thank you so much for sharing all that knowledge and all the work you've done and you know to be able to um sit there for you know a few hours and just you know really share that knowledge with us. Very grateful for that. One thing that popped up for me was we talked about, you know, when the people come on and they'll be connected to LinkedIn and they'll have a certain certified badge almost to say that they've done the work. Did we talk with, is that also connected to JobSeeker as well? Will they have a verified badge on JobSeeker too to say that they've done this sort of work with us? You know, that creates a bigger profile for themselves that they have a deeper understanding of systems thinking? Yeah, I think the, sorry if I've misspoken that one, what we'll create is just a parallel CV that then people can trade on. So if they want, it's then up to the individual. So if they then want to put it into LinkedIn, they can put it into LinkedIn and it gives them trading capacity. So at the moment, you know, a lot of our trade is like, look at me, I did it. So you capture a photo of, you know, a sunrise or somewhere else. I actually did that, you know, and that provides part of it. Someone's like, oh, a photo of you know a sunrise or somewhere else i actually did that you know and that provides part there someone's like oh they know how to do a sunrise ceremony so i saw a video of that thing so the will at a base level commit that we'll do the credit stuff that we know we can with our governance system of people around it and everyone around it this stacks up as imagination university qualified imagination qualified that this person has done this body of work and and that that can well and truly be valued as an accreditation tick for the behavior and we can document it etc etc the the one of the interesting pieces in the next eight years is going to be what trading opportunities we can help with piping in systemically so some of you might have seen that ted talks um are looking for a new owner to take over um there's groups like ted or groups like you know airbnb or travel like routing playgrounds that systemically that could be really interesting to see what opens up to go okay well do you want to do you want to now start to take some of these tokens like the hoodie token from inside imagination and place it in here what does that get you access to so that's definitely there for us to explore and something we want to look at it's there's enough that we're taking on that if we don't get there and that happens organically cool that's another way that it can move you know someone might just come in and their project might be I want to make Airbnb healthier. The CEO of Airbnb comes in two years and they take hoodies or they rip the hoodie. Like ideally for me, replace the hoodie with whatever your tokens are. Just take the engineering and improve the healthier network. If Facebook could take what we've built with imagination and build it in, we're happy to give open source what we've got. So it'll be sort of a combination of those things, I reckon, Arthur, like play the credit hack, play within this frame and then see what we can help with to seed that getting back into existing fiat systems, like existing systems of economic movement. So there's someone who can get an exchange where they can get a coffee or they can get something else so we can see that move in other areas. And if we pipe one or two of those case studies, then that's probably powerful enough to move it else so we can see that move in other areas and if we pipe one or two of those case studies then that's probably powerful enough um you know to move it and hopefully after that the third section is actually actually going out to the existing networks that are busted and saying how to improve the health of these networks you know if ted's going to shut down do we want to help them shape what ted looks like in the next decade or you know do we do that for facebook when they start to shut down maybe in 10 years you know what what's the where can we help with the network problem to the network potential is where i think our design support will sit in and yeah um that's a that's a good question thanks for bringing it up that's a question yeah um hey guys brendo here we I've been in a process of sitting in this room working through a lot of the River Runs videos. So some of the really clear blocks that people will experience as they go do their work and imagination has been, I've been working at AIM 11 years and we've been building imagination for what, three four years and it's really interesting comprehension I sat in the room with the board like a couple weeks ago and re-watched the the um tour video and it's it's been a like super interesting seeing the key parts like fold out and there's so much depth to them and for me it's been really illuminating just to kind of see that that the bits make sense and so much depth to each element um and so my question is like as i go out to lots of people being able to distill those elements and super exciting to see it all match up. You don't see it match up in the first watch, you know. So at the start of the call, we talked about the three network settings that we're looking to kind of reshape. Can you go through those three network issues or problems that you yeah yeah i think that um the um there's the building of empires like the colonial empire challenge yeah um and then the second challenge for us is the modern social network and what it's done with attention and that plus turbo turbo powered with devices that take the computer from being a place that we go to to being inside of us um so attention is number two yep um and what what is and the weaponizing of attention and then number three is our network relationship to nature. So there are three problems. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for letting me share the space. I know we've got three more of these or two more of these. Two to go, yeah. Yeah, so amazing. So amazing to be here with all of you as the inception custodians of this thing and, yeah, um yes radical that we get to roll it out next month and that there's these these blocks that people will walk through and i know there's plenty of exceptional people that are they're going to walk into it and um yeah thanks oh good bro thanks for the question Yeah, thanks. All good, bro. Thanks for the question. I might jump in and let someone else have a go. But thank you so much for the grounding, Jack, at the beginning, taking us back to our old people and everything that has come before us, those relations, the networks, the healthy networks, the connections, and really taking us on a journey through our imagination visually and taking the time to do that to really set us, set that grounding to move into the knowledge sharing. You took us back to what we've known. And then you took us to where we are now. And then you then explained where we could be, where we want to be with this network that we've put in place now. And what, you know, all those five groups would be coming in, the corporations, the citizens, the young people. And also, you know, those five groups would be coming in, the corporations, the citizens, the young people, and also, you know, the series that we have coming up. So, yeah, thank you for taking the time to really do that the right way, brother, and sharing that with us. Learn from the best, Baba. Baba. There's a question in the chat line from Danson. I don't know if Danson wants to speak. And I'm sorry if I've mispronounced your name. Hello? Hello. Apologies, my phone camera has failed and I have not replaced my phone, so I'm not able to join the video sections thank you very much for sharing about aim uh but my name's i'm called in general and joker i need to update my zoom i haven't been on here in a while uh from emble kenya and my question is relation to language um and how so much wisdom and knowledge is carried through that, and how the language that we use impacts our relations. I'm curious to hear that piece. I'm sure it's been a lot of unheard of, many things are shared today, maybe I missed that piece. But I'm curious to hear about the language that will be used within imagination as well as how Indigenous languages will be promoted to enhance the moving to the front of the queue of the Indigenous ideas and designers and to enable them to be able to hear. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. And nice to meet you through the internet fog world. Yeah, there's definitely, it's a great question because it's like that, it's definitely a challenge for us to work out and it's not a perfect solution that we've got right now. And I hope in the course of the next seven eight years it becomes enhanced as well um our capacity to translate as I said in that collab piece um I think is is the probably the critical part and a lot of it is translating between each other and translating across languages um so that at this stage we've built it in English is number one with then creating a number of experiences where there's space for dialogue for people to move and for text to have richer format than just being in the written word. So we've got radio, that tool of radio we're looking to lean into and the ability for people to gather and and be in their own different context in the unlikely connections of five and bring their own context in and then hopefully be able to utilize some of the tools that we've got um access to in terms of translation to to bring it outside in um to help people be able to understand and meet in the middle. So yeah, it was one of the haunting questions, I think, and why part of the reasons why we've also limited it, this particular delivery to be able to find the people that can code switch and that have got the capacity to move in between multiple languages and be those translators and why we're looking for the, you know, one to 10,000 who have had access to their different knowledges in their different circumstances and can code switch into English to find a middle ground together, which is imperfect, but is somewhere. So, yeah, that's kind of part of the context around it with more, hopefully, capacity for us to enhance the only thing that we like budget-wise if we you know get the chance to be able to update the only thing we want to be able to update is just the translation of all the texts to multiple languages and multiple forms so that's that's a body of work for us with the tool creation and that's the part where imperfect now but hopefully eight years from now we can leave behind a bunch of tools that can be translated across many different languages and something we're looking at with this Professors TV series as well. And then in terms of Indigenous knowledges being brought to the start of the design queue, that was in terms of inside imagination, that was kind of the easy part because that's just who we are like so i'm indigenous myself to australia um we've got indigenous leadership throughout the organization we've worked with indigenous people for 20 years um in australia and in different places around the world and then so that who we are we had that part there but we didn't understand how to do it and the indigenous knowledge Knowledge Systems Labs out of Deakin University and Tyson Yonkaporta's work with Sandtalk has helped give us a roadmap of theory and a theory of change as to how to apply it. So we've been able to take this idea and then start applying it to real-world challenges like how to build a bioregional economy in a healthy way and how to, you know, build a digital country. So the way we've done the designing has been segmented into a number of rolling conversations with people, rolling stories with people either in the country, on the internet. The group that we actually paid to build Imagination for six months, we asked them not to build anything and to talk and to sit and to listen and we went up and had fires with them on the river where they worked and um and it was horrible because we're like i'm like man we're never going to build this thing we're never going to get it out in time but if we didn't spend the time getting to know each other properly across that divide um and take that time to orient more healthily than we thought the bones of the thing would never be able to work. So yeah, imperfect and definitely a North Star for us to hold up all the time. Like how do we continue to make the translation as possible as it can be? And I think the final answer to it is by building a depth of relations between each other has been the way that we've been able to translate across divides around the world so by me being able to learn um siaka's ways and and to have a depth of spirit relationship with him then the language become the actual words itself um are less significant than our spirit connection and the the soul connection um so if we can build that depth of relational connection then the words um become what they should be which is just an artifact or a tool for us to to extend that deeper relation so i think the time together will hopefully allow for that depth of of understanding to to grow of understanding to grow. Asante. And to you. I just want to jump in as one of the professors here at Imagination and say thank you for taking this time Jack to always expand that map to grow and grow and grow that context in all those really healthy ways ready to get to work bubble bubble thanks team thanks professor song Thanks, Professor Song. We might round it out there unless anyone's got any burning insights that they'd love to jump in on. Then hopefully we'll have these, maybe we'll have these sit on, these three town halls can just sit on the website as well as part of the dialogues, you know, so they can be tools for people to access in the future. Yeah, happy to share it, keep giving it away. Thanks for your engagement. It took a long time to listen. And let's do the thing. Thank you, Jack. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, Jack. Thank you, everyone. Thanks for seeing you all, helping me improve just by visually seeing you all. Thank you. Have a great one. Adi. Yo. Adi.",
