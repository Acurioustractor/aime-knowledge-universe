# Community Integration Platform - Design Document

## Overview

The Community Integration Platform transforms AIME's knowledge platform into a living ecosystem where relationships drive learning and collective impact. Built on the philosophy that "building relationships is a revolutionary act," this system creates meaningful connections that amplify individual growth into community transformation.

The design leverages AIME's existing sophisticated infrastructure - including semantic search, philosophy-first architecture, and user context modeling - to create intelligent community features that feel natural and purposeful rather than forced or artificial.
