# Community Integration Platform - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Community Integration Platform builds upon AIME's existing knowledge platform to create meaningful connections between users, enabling collaborative learning, mentorship networks, and regional communities. This system embodies AIME's philosophy that "in a world that profits from disconnection, building relationships is a revolutionary act."

The platform will transform individual learning into collective impact by connecting people with shared interests, complementary skills, and aligned values around AIME's philosophy domains.
