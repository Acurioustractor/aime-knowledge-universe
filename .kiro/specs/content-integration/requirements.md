# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The IMAGI-NATION Wiki needs a comprehensive content integration system that brings together diverse content from multiple sources (YouTube videos, Airtable resources, GitHub repositories, etc.) and presents them in a cohesive, story-focused way. Rather than displaying raw repository information, the system should extract and showcase the actual stories, data, insights, and links contained within these sources, organized by themes, topics, and relevance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Source Integration

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to integrate content from multiple sources (YouTube, Airtable, GitHub repositories) into a unified platform, so that users can access all AIME knowledge in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system connects to YouTube THEN it SHALL retrieve all IMAGI-NATION {TV} episodes with their metadata (title, description, tags, etc.)
2. WHEN the system connects to Airtable THEN it SHALL retrieve all resources, toolkits, and events with their structured data
3. WHEN the system connects to GitHub repositories (aime-knowledge-hub, aime-artifacts, AIMEdashboards) THEN it SHALL extract meaningful content (markdown files, PDFs, etc.) rather than just listing repository files
4. WHEN content is retrieved from any source THEN it SHALL be normalized into a consistent format with appropriate metadata
5. WHEN APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 2: Content Organization by Theme

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse content organized by themes and topics rather than by source, so that I can explore ideas across different media formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the content section THEN they SHALL see content organized by themes (Imagination & Creativity, Relational Economies, Indigenous Systems Thinking, etc.)
2. WHEN a user selects a theme THEN they SHALL see all content related to that theme regardless of source (videos, documents, resources)
3. WHEN content is displayed THEN it SHALL show the most relevant information (title, description, key insights) rather than technical metadata
4. WHEN the system categorizes content THEN it SHALL use consistent taxonomy across all sources
5. WHEN new content is added to any source THEN it SHALL be automatically categorized based on its content and metadata

### Requirement 3: Story-Focused Presentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see content presented as stories and insights rather than as repository files or database records, so that I can engage with the ideas more meaningfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a YouTube video THEN the system SHALL highlight key insights, quotes, and themes rather than just technical details
2. WHEN displaying content from GitHub repositories THEN the system SHALL extract and present the narrative content rather than showing file listings
3. WHEN displaying Airtable resources THEN the system SHALL focus on the purpose and value of each resource rather than its database structure
4. WHEN presenting any content THEN the system SHALL use rich media, quotes, and visual elements to enhance the storytelling
5. WHEN a user views content THEN they SHALL see related content from other sources that continues or expands the story

### Requirement 4: Unified Search and Discovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search across all content sources using natural language and topics, so that I can find relevant information regardless of where it's stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL return results from all integrated sources
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance to the query rather than by source
3. WHEN a user searches for a concept or theme THEN the system SHALL find content that discusses that concept even if the exact terms aren't used
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL be grouped by theme or topic rather than by source
5. WHEN a user refines their search THEN the system SHALL provide filters for content type, theme, region, and participant type

### Requirement 5: Content Explorer Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface to explore all content across different dimensions (themes, regions, participant types), so that I can discover new connections and insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Content Explorer THEN they SHALL see a visual interface for browsing content across multiple dimensions
2. WHEN a user selects a filter or category THEN the interface SHALL update dynamically to show matching content
3. WHEN content is displayed in the explorer THEN it SHALL show rich previews with visual elements
4. WHEN a user hovers over content THEN they SHALL see connections to related content
5. WHEN a user discovers interesting content THEN they SHALL be able to save it to collections or share it easily

### Requirement 6: Knowledge Hub Integration

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to integrate the Knowledge Hub repositories in a way that presents their content as structured knowledge rather than files, so that users can access the wisdom within them more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system integrates with the Knowledge Hub repositories THEN it SHALL extract structured knowledge from markdown files, PDFs, and other documents
2. WHEN Knowledge Hub content is displayed THEN it SHALL be organized by topic and purpose rather than by file structure
3. WHEN a user accesses Knowledge Hub content THEN they SHALL see related content from other sources
4. WHEN new content is added to the Knowledge Hub repositories THEN it SHALL be automatically integrated and categorized
5. WHEN displaying Knowledge Hub content THEN the system SHALL preserve any structured data or metadata while presenting it in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 7: Impact Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see impact data and visualizations integrated with related content, so that I can understand the real-world effects of AIME's work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system integrates with the AIMEdashboards repository THEN it SHALL extract meaningful visualizations and data
2. WHEN impact data is displayed THEN it SHALL be connected to relevant stories, videos, and resources
3. WHEN a user views impact data THEN they SHALL be able to explore the underlying stories and context
4. WHEN impact dashboards are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the integrated view
5. WHEN displaying impact data THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate context and explanation

### Requirement 8: Content Relationships and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see relationships between different content items and navigate between related items easily, so that I can follow threads of thought across different sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a content item is displayed THEN the system SHALL show related items from all sources
2. WHEN relationships between content are displayed THEN the system SHALL explain the nature of the relationship
3. WHEN a user navigates between related content THEN the system SHALL maintain context and continuity
4. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL automatically identify relationships with existing content
