# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AIME Knowledge Platform requires a comprehensive redesign to transform from a technical content repository into a world-class living knowledge ecosystem. The platform must prioritize philosophy-first explanations, intelligent content discovery, elegant design, and sophisticated relationship mapping while supporting ongoing tool development like the Mentor App and Hoodie Stock Exchange observatory.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Philosophy-First Content Architecture

**User Story:** As a user exploring AIME's knowledge, I want to understand the philosophical foundations and business cases before encountering implementation tools, so that I can grasp the "why" behind the approaches and make informed decisions about application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters any knowledge domain THEN they SHALL see a philosophy primer that explains core concepts and principles
2. WHEN a user views implementation tools THEN they SHALL have access to contextual explanations of underlying philosophy
3. WHEN a user explores business cases THEN they SHALL see evidence-based narratives that illustrate why approaches work
4. WHEN a user navigates between concepts THEN they SHALL see clear theory-to-practice bridges
5. WHEN a user encounters complex topics THEN they SHALL have access to progressive disclosure that reveals complexity gradually

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Content Discovery System

**User Story:** As a user seeking relevant knowledge, I want the platform to intelligently surface content based on my interests and context rather than requiring explicit search, so that I can discover valuable insights I might not have known to look for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN they SHALL see personalized content recommendations based on their role and interests
2. WHEN a user views content THEN they SHALL see contextually relevant related content in sidebars
3. WHEN a user explores a topic THEN they SHALL see trending insights and seasonally relevant content
4. WHEN a user returns to the platform THEN they SHALL see updates and new connections to previously viewed content
5. WHEN a user browses content THEN they SHALL see intelligent cross-domain suggestions that reveal unexpected connections

### Requirement 3: Advanced Semantic Search Engine

**User Story:** As a user looking for specific information, I want a search system that understands my intent and context rather than just matching keywords, so that I can find relevant content quickly and discover related insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for content THEN the system SHALL understand intent and context, not just keyword matching
2. WHEN a user receives search results THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance to user's current focus area
3. WHEN a user searches across content types THEN they SHALL see unified results from videos, tools, research, and stories
4. WHEN a user explores search results THEN they SHALL see visual relationship maps showing how concepts connect
5. WHEN a user searches for complex topics THEN they SHALL receive AI-generated summaries and key insights

### Requirement 4: Content Relationship Engine

**User Story:** As a user exploring AIME's knowledge base, I want to see how different concepts, tools, and stories connect to each other, so that I can understand the holistic nature of AIME's approach and find implementation pathways.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any content THEN they SHALL see related content organized by relationship type (implements, supports, builds_on)
2. WHEN a user explores concepts THEN they SHALL see visual maps of how ideas cluster and connect
3. WHEN a user looks at implementation tools THEN they SHALL see the philosophical foundations and supporting evidence
4. WHEN a user reads stories THEN they SHALL see connections to relevant tools and theoretical frameworks
5. WHEN a user navigates relationships THEN they SHALL see relationship strength and contextual explanations

### Requirement 5: Hoodie Stock Exchange Observatory

**User Story:** As a user interested in Hoodie Economics, I want to observe and understand the concept through data visualization and case studies without needing to interact directly, so that I can grasp the philosophy and see evidence of its effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Hoodie Observatory THEN they SHALL see clear explanations of relational vs transactional economics
2. WHEN a user explores value visualization THEN they SHALL see interactive charts showing how relational value compounds over time
3. WHEN a user views impact metrics THEN they SHALL see real-time simulated data showing community health indicators
4. WHEN a user examines case studies THEN they SHALL see detailed implementation stories with measurable outcomes
5. WHEN a user considers implementation THEN they SHALL see step-by-step pathways and assessment tools

### Requirement 6: Elegant User Experience Design

**User Story:** As a user navigating the platform, I want a clean, elegant interface that focuses my attention on content and relationships without visual clutter or overwhelming complexity, so that I can engage deeply with AIME's knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any page THEN they SHALL see clean, uncluttered interfaces with clear information hierarchy
2. WHEN a user navigates the platform THEN they SHALL experience contextual, relationship-driven navigation rather than rigid menus
3. WHEN a user encounters complex information THEN they SHALL see progressive disclosure that maintains simplicity
4. WHEN a user accesses content THEN they SHALL experience consistent design language that reflects AIME's human-centered approach
5. WHEN a user uses any device THEN they SHALL have seamless responsive experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Requirement 7: Smart Content Synthesis and Summaries

**User Story:** As a user exploring complex topics, I want intelligent summaries and synthesis that help me quickly grasp key concepts and see big-picture connections, so that I can efficiently understand AIME's comprehensive knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores knowledge domains THEN they SHALL see comprehensive yet accessible topic overviews
2. WHEN a user views implementation guides THEN they SHALL see step-by-step pathways from concept to practice
3. WHEN a user examines research THEN they SHALL see evidence synthesis that aggregates findings and impact stories
4. WHEN a user compares approaches THEN they SHALL see cross-reference tables comparing tools, methods, and outcomes
5. WHEN a user encounters new content THEN they SHALL see AI-generated insights highlighting key themes and connections

### Requirement 8: Living Applications Integration

**User Story:** As a user interested in AIME's ongoing innovations, I want to see how knowledge connects to living applications like the Mentor App and community dashboards, so that I can understand how theory translates into practical tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores mentoring concepts THEN they SHALL see connections to the Mentor App development and philosophy
2. WHEN a user views community building tools THEN they SHALL see how they relate to dashboard implementations
3. WHEN a user examines assessment frameworks THEN they SHALL see how they connect to evaluation tools in development
