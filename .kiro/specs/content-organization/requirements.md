# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The IMAGI-NATION Wiki needs a strategic content organization approach that focuses on the purpose and value of content rather than its technical source. Currently, content is primarily organized by repository or API source (YouTube, GitHub, Airtable), which doesn't effectively showcase the rich knowledge, stories, and tools from these repositories in a meaningful way. This feature will reorganize content by its purpose and value to users, creating a more intuitive and story-focused experience.
