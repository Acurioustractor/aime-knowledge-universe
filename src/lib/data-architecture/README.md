### 4. Real-Time Data Pipeline (`pipeline/data-pipeline.ts`)

Enterprise-grade pipeline for content ingestion and processing:

#### Ingestion Sources:
- **YouTube**: Videos, transcripts, comments
- **Airtable**: Structured program data
- **GitHub**: Documentation and resources
- **Mailchimp**: Newsletter archives
- **Webhooks**: Real-time event data
- **APIs**: Partner integrations
- **Streams**: Kafka, Redis, WebSocket

#### Processing Features:
- **Transformation Engine**: Normalizes data to unified model
- **Enrichment Pipeline**: Adds geocoding, translation, sentiment
- **Validation Framework**: Ensures data quality
- **Deduplication**: Intelligent duplicate detection
- **Error Handling**: Retry mechanisms and dead letter queues

#### Monitoring:
