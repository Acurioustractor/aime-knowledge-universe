## üéØ WHAT IS AIME?

AIME (Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience) began in 2005 as a mentoring program connecting Indigenous high school students with university mentors. Over 20 years, it has evolved into a global movement that challenges the fundamental assumptions of how we organize society, create value, and relate to each other and the planet.

### Core Vision
AIME envisions a fairer world where:
- **Imagination** is valued as the primary currency of human potential
- **Relationships** form the foundation of all economic and social systems
- **Indigenous wisdom** guides modern solutions to contemporary challenges
- **Young people** lead the transformation of outdated systems
- **Nature** is recognized as a teacher and partner, not a resource

### The Transformation
From a mentoring program ‚Üí To a global network of imagination activists building:
- **Hoodie Economics**: A new economic model based on relationships, not transactions
- **IMAGI-NATION {University}**: A borderless nation of learners reimagining everything
- **Knowledge Universe**: An intelligent system making all wisdom accessible globally
- **Joy Corps**: Organizations transformed through relational principles
- **Indigenous Systems Thinking**: Ancient wisdom applied to modern challenges

## üí´ HOODIE ECONOMICS: THE RELATIONAL REVOLUTION

### What is Hoodie Economics?

Hoodie Economics represents a fundamental reimagining of value creation and exchange. Named after AIME's iconic hoodies that became symbols of belonging and identity, this economic model prioritizes relationships, imagination, and collective flourishing over individual accumulation.

### Core Principles

1. **Relationships as Wealth**
   - True wealth lies in the quality and depth of our connections
   - Every interaction creates potential for mutual growth
   - Trust and reciprocity replace contracts and enforcement

2. **Imagination as Currency**
   - Creative capacity becomes the primary measure of value
   - Ideas and innovations are shared freely to multiply impact
   - Problems are opportunities for imaginative collaboration

3. **Validation Through Community**
   - Value is determined by collective benefit, not market forces
   - Multi-tier validation ensures cultural appropriateness
   - Elder wisdom guides economic decisions

4. **Regeneration Over Extraction**
   - All activities must contribute to systemic health
   - Taking without giving back becomes economically impossible
   - Future generations' needs drive present decisions

### How It Works in Practice

#### The Digital Hoodie System
- **Earning**: Contribute knowledge, mentor others, solve community challenges
- **Trading**: Exchange based on relational value, not monetary worth
- **Validation**: Community consensus determines hoodie worth
- **Impact**: Each trade strengthens the network and creates new possibilities

#### Real-World Application
- **Schools**: Students earn hoodies through mentoring younger peers
- **Organizations**: Companies trade expertise for community benefit
- **Communities**: Local solutions get shared globally through the network
- **Individuals**: Personal growth directly contributes to collective flourishing

## üåç IMAGI-NATION {UNIVERSITY}: LEARNING WITHOUT BORDERS

### The Concept

IMAGI-NATION {University} is not a place but a state of being. It's a borderless nation where citizenship is earned through imagination, contribution, and commitment to systemic change. Unlike traditional universities that segregate knowledge into disciplines, IMAGI-NATION integrates all learning into lived experience.

### Core Components

1. **Universal Imagination Curriculum**
   - Develops creative problem-solving across all domains
   - Integrates Indigenous knowledge systems as core content
   - Focuses on real-world application, not theoretical knowledge

2. **Intergenerational Learning**
   - Young people teach technological fluency
   - Elders share wisdom and cultural knowledge
   - All ages learn together as equals

3. **Project-Based Transformation**
   - Learning happens through solving real community challenges
   - Every project must benefit multiple stakeholders
   - Success measured by systemic impact, not individual achievement

4. **Global Classroom**
   - Physical spaces (Imagination Labs) in schools and communities
   - Digital platforms connecting learners worldwide
   - Nature as the primary classroom for systems thinking

### Citizenship Levels

1. **Imagination Apprentice**: Beginning to see possibilities beyond current reality
2. **Systems Thinker**: Understanding interconnections and leverage points
3. **Change Catalyst**: Actively transforming local systems
4. **Global Citizen**: Contributing to worldwide transformation networks
5. **Elder Guide**: Mentoring others in their transformation journey

## üåø INDIGENOUS SYSTEMS THINKING: ANCIENT WISDOM FOR MODERN CHALLENGES

### The Foundation

Indigenous systems thinking recognizes that all elements of existence are interconnected and that human flourishing depends on maintaining balance within these relationships. This isn't about romanticizing the past but applying time-tested principles to contemporary challenges.

### Key Principles

1. **Seven Generation Thinking**
   - Every decision evaluated for impact seven generations into the future
   - Short-term gains never justify long-term harm
   - Children yet unborn have a voice in current decisions

2. **Reciprocal Relationships**
   - Taking must be balanced with giving
   - All beings (human and non-human) have inherent rights
   - Gratitude and ceremony maintain relational balance

3. **Collective Decision-Making**
   - Consensus-building over majority rule
   - Multiple perspectives strengthen solutions
   - Patience in process prevents future conflicts

4. **Knowledge as Responsibility**
   - Wisdom comes with obligations to share appropriately
   - Sacred knowledge requires proper protocols
   - Learning is always in service of community

### Modern Applications

- **Climate Solutions**: Viewing Earth as a living system requiring care, not management
- **Economic Models**: Circular economies that regenerate rather than deplete
- **Governance Systems**: Decision-making that includes all affected beings
- **Education Approaches**: Learning through relationship with place and community
- **Health Practices**: Treating root causes in systemic context, not just symptoms
