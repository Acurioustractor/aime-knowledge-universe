# AIME Knowledge Universe - Core Testing Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing framework designed to validate the AIME Knowledge Universe platform against core AIME philosophies and principles. The framework emerged from a thorough database analysis and is designed to ensure the platform truly serves Indigenous knowledge sharing, community building, and relationship-centered learning.

## Background

Following a comprehensive database schema analysis that revealed:
- **20+ interconnected tables** supporting sophisticated content management
- **Dual-database architecture** (SQLite + Supabase) for performance and features
- **Multi-source data integration** from Airtable, YouTube, Mailchimp, GitHub
- **Indigenous knowledge protocols** with cultural sensitivity frameworks
- **Hoodie Stock Exchange** gamification system for relationship-centered learning

We identified the need for philosophical alignment testing to ensure technical sophistication translates into mission-aligned functionality.
