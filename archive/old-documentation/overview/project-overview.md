# IMAGI-NATION Research Synthesis Plan

## Project Vision
Transform 250+ IMAGI-NATION {TV} episodes and workshops into a landmark research synthesis that captures the collective intelligence of a global imagination generation designing the future from the depths of the pandemic.

## Core Mission
This research synthesis will demonstrate that AIME didn't just study the future—they built it with the very people who will inhabit it. The 250+ conversations weren't focus groups; they were activation ceremonies for a new relational economy.

## Key Differentiators
- **Live co-design** captured in real-time
- **Planetary scope** with local depth
- **Youth-led** with intergenerational wisdom
- **Action-oriented** with built solutions (IMAGI-NATION)
- **Culturally grounded** in Indigenous systems thinking
- **Relationally distributed** not transactionally marketed

## Timeline Overview
- **December 2024**: Research Consolidation
- **December 2024 - January 2025**: Deep Analysis & Synthesis
- **January 2025**: Creative Production
- **January 26, 2025**: Strategic Global Release

## Impact Vision
This will be more than research—it's a blueprint for transformation that governments, educators, and communities can immediately implement.
