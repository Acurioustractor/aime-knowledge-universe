- Multiple competing visions and architectures
- Rich content scattered across technical silos

### **Target State:** 25 coherent routes serving clear user journeys
- Philosophy-first design with Indigenous wisdom guidance
- 5 clear pathways supporting natural user progression  
- Sophisticated search serving simple discovery needs
- Rich data integrated seamlessly across purpose-based hubs

### **Transformation Impact:**

- **Technical Complexity → Simple Experience:** Sophisticated systems serving Indigenous wisdom
- **Content Silos → Integrated Discovery:** Cross-application intelligence
- **Individual Focus → Community Building:** Relationship-centered design throughout

---

## 💫 **Implementation Commitment**

This route consolidation serves the mission of making Indigenous wisdom accessible while respecting cultural protocols. Every navigation decision, every page structure, every user journey serves the purpose of creating transformational learning experiences.

**We organize routes to serve wisdom, not technical convenience. We design user journeys to build community, not just consume content. We integrate search to surface unexpected connections, not just match keywords.**

The 83+ current routes represent the complexity of profound work accomplished. The 25 target routes represent the simplicity needed for transformational user experiences.

**From technical complexity to philosophical clarity. From scattered content to purposeful journeys. From individual consumption to community transformation.**

---

*This route mapping serves the .kiro philosophy-first approach, ensuring every page supports Indigenous knowledge sharing, community building, and relationship-centered learning. Every route serves transformation.*

**Navigation serves wisdom. User journeys build community. Page consistency honors Indigenous protocols.**
