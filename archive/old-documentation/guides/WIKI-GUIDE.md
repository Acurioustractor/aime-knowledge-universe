# IMAGI-NATION Wiki Guide
## Your Roadmap to an Amazing Wiki Experience

Congratulations! You now have the foundation for an exceptional wiki that will showcase the IMAGI-NATION Research Synthesis in a powerful, interconnected way. This guide explains what we've built and how to proceed.

## What We've Created

### 1. Comprehensive Structure
We've established a well-organized wiki structure that:
- Mirrors your research synthesis plan's phases and components
- Creates clear pathways for different user journeys
- Balances depth with accessibility
- Provides multiple entry points based on user interests

### 2. Core Content Pages
We've created the essential pages that form the backbone of your wiki:
- Main landing page (README.md)
- Section overview pages for all major areas
- Sample detailed content (Schools as Imagination Labs recommendation)
- Visual wiki structure map
- Implementation toolkit example

### 3. Integration Framework
We've provided a clear path for connecting your existing content:
- Detailed integration guide for Airtable and YouTube content
- Structured content organization by theme, region, and participant type
- Templates for consistent content presentation

## Next Steps

### 1. Content Population
Start populating the wiki with your existing content:
- Follow the [Content Integration Guide](./content/integration-guide.md)
- Begin with one theme or region as a pilot
- Establish consistent metadata tagging across content

### 2. Technical Setup
Set up the technical infrastructure to support your wiki:
- Configure a static site generator (like Docusaurus, MkDocs, or GitBook)
- Establish automated workflows for content updates
- Set up search functionality across the wiki

### 3. Visual Design
Enhance the visual experience:
- Create a consistent visual identity
- Design custom icons for different content types
- Develop infographics for key concepts
- Add images and video embeds throughout

### 4. Interactive Elements
Add interactive components to engage users:
- Timeline visualization of the research process
- Interactive map showing global participation
- Recommendation explorer with filtering capabilities
- Quote database with search and filtering

## Implementation Approach

### Option 1: Manual Population
- Use the structure we've created as a template
- Manually add content from your Airtable and YouTube sources
- Best for smaller content sets or when you want maximum control

### Option 2: Semi-Automated
- Use scripts to extract content from Airtable
- Generate markdown files based on templates
- Manually review and enhance each page
- Best balance of efficiency and quality

### Option 3: Fully Automated
- Develop a complete pipeline from Airtable to wiki
- Set up continuous integration for updates
- Use AI to assist with content organization and cross-linking
- Best for large content sets with frequent updates

## Content Creation Priorities

1. **Complete Core Structure Pages**
   - Fill in any missing README files in subdirectories
   - Ensure all navigation links work correctly

2. **Develop Key Recommendation Pages**
   - Create detailed pages for all 10 recommendations
   - Include rich media, quotes, and implementation guidance

3. **Build Content Archive**
   - Organize and link to all 250+ episodes
   - Create thematic collections and playlists

4. **Enhance Global Voices Section**
   - Feature diverse participants with quotes and videos
   - Create regional and demographic perspectives

5. **Finalize Implementation Resources**
   - Complete all toolkit pages
   - Create downloadable resources for different contexts

## Technical Recommendations

### Recommended Wiki Platforms
1. **Docusaurus** - React-based, great for technical documentation
2. **GitBook** - Clean, modern interface with good collaboration features
3. **MkDocs with Material theme** - Lightweight and highly customizable
4. **Notion** - If you prefer a more visual, database-driven approach

### Automation Tools
- **Airtable API** - Direct connection to your content database
- **YouTube Data API** - Programmatic access to video content
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated workflows for content updates
- **Netlify/Vercel** - Continuous deployment of your wiki

## Final Tips

1. **Start Small** - Begin with one section and perfect your process
2. **Maintain Consistency** - Use templates for similar content types
3. **Prioritize Search** - Ensure users can find what they need quickly
4. **Gather Feedback** - Test with different user groups early
5. **Think Relationally** - Create rich connections between content pieces
