# Documentation Consolidation Plan
## Unifying All Strategic Documents Around .kiro Approach

*Action plan to eliminate conflicting visions and establish single source of truth*

---

## üéØ **Consolidation Objectives**

1. **Eliminate Confusion:** Remove competing navigation and architecture visions
2. **Establish Single Truth:** .kiro approach becomes THE standard for all decisions  
3. **Simplify User Experience:** Clear pathways instead of document chaos
4. **Preserve Wisdom:** Archive rather than delete valuable insights

---

## üìã **File Actions Required**

### **üóÇÔ∏è CREATE `/archive/` FOLDER**
Move outdated documents that conflict with .kiro approach:

```bash
mkdir archive
mkdir archive/outdated-approaches
mkdir archive/early-iterations
```

### **üìÅ ARCHIVE (Move to `/archive/outdated-approaches/`)**

#### **AIME_UX_REDESIGN_ANALYSIS.md** ‚Üí `archive/outdated-approaches/`
- **Reason:** Proposes different 5-pathway structure than .kiro
- **Conflicts:** Different hoodie system vision, competing navigation
- **Preserve:** Good UX problem identification for reference

#### **AIME_WIKI_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md** ‚Üí `archive/outdated-approaches/`
- **Reason:** 9-section structure conflicts with .kiro 5-pathway approach
- **Conflicts:** Source-based organization vs purpose-based
- **Preserve:** Technical integration insights valuable for reference

#### **NEXT-STEPS.md** ‚Üí `archive/early-iterations/`
- **Reason:** Completely outdated technical focus from early development
- **Conflicts:** Basic API setup vs sophisticated philosophy-first platform
- **Preserve:** Historical record of project evolution

### **üìù REPLACE CORE DOCUMENTS**

#### **README.md** ‚Üí Replace with `README-UNIFIED.md`
```bash
mv README.md archive/early-iterations/README-original.md
mv README-UNIFIED.md README.md
```

#### **CONTENT-INTEGRATION.md** ‚Üí Replace with `TECHNICAL-INTEGRATION-SIMPLIFIED.md`
```bash
mv CONTENT-INTEGRATION.md archive/outdated-approaches/CONTENT-INTEGRATION-technical-focus.md
mv TECHNICAL-INTEGRATION-SIMPLIFIED.md CONTENT-INTEGRATION.md
```

### **‚úÖ KEEP & ALIGN EXISTING DOCUMENTS**

#### **MASTER_AIME_PHILOSOPHY_AND_SYSTEMS.md** ‚úÖ **KEEP AS-IS**
- **Status:** Perfect alignment with .kiro philosophy-first approach
- **Role:** Master philosophy document referenced by all pathways
- **Action:** No changes needed - already supports .kiro vision

#### **CORE.md** ‚úÖ **KEEP WITH MINOR UPDATES**
- **Status:** Testing framework aligns with .kiro cultural protocols
- **Role:** Ensures technical implementation serves philosophical mission
- **Action:** Update success metrics to match .kiro 5-pathway structure

#### **AIME_COMPREHENSIVE_REDESIGN_STRATEGY.md** ‚Üí **SELECTIVE PRESERVATION**
- **Action:** Extract aligned sections, archive the rest
- **Keep:** "Clarity over Complexity" principles, philosophy-first business cases
- **Archive:** Conflicting navigation proposals, competing architectural visions

## üìÑ **New Document Structure Post-Consolidation**

### **Primary Strategic Documents**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (Unified platform overview with .kiro structure)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MASTER_AIME_PHILOSOPHY_AND_SYSTEMS.md (Philosophy foundation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md (10-week .kiro implementation plan)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTENT-INTEGRATION.md (Technical integration serving philosophy)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CORE.md (Testing framework for philosophical alignment)
```

### **Supporting Documentation**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .kiro/specs/ (Detailed specifications - single source of truth)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/ (User guides and community documentation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/ (Historical documents and outdated approaches)
```

---

## üîÑ **Step-by-Step Consolidation Process**

### **Phase 1: Archive Conflicting Documents** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create archive structure
mkdir -p archive/outdated-approaches
mkdir -p archive/early-iterations

# Move conflicting documents
mv AIME_UX_REDESIGN_ANALYSIS.md archive/outdated-approaches/
mv AIME_WIKI_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md archive/outdated-approaches/
mv NEXT-STEPS.md archive/early-iterations/

# Preserve original README and CONTENT-INTEGRATION
mv README.md archive/early-iterations/README-original.md
mv CONTENT-INTEGRATION.md archive/outdated-approaches/CONTENT-INTEGRATION-technical-focus.md
```

### **Phase 2: Install New Unified Documents** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Install new unified documents
mv README-UNIFIED.md README.md
mv TECHNICAL-INTEGRATION-SIMPLIFIED.md CONTENT-INTEGRATION.md

# Verify IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md is in place
ls -la IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md
```

### **Phase 3: Update References** (30 minutes)
- [ ] Update any internal links in remaining documents
- [ ] Ensure .kiro specs remain as authoritative source
- [ ] Update navigation components if they reference archived documents
- [ ] Test that all new document links work correctly

### **Phase 4: Verification** (15 minutes)
- [ ] Confirm no broken links in active documents
- [ ] Verify .kiro approach is consistently presented across all documents
- [ ] Check that archived documents are accessible but clearly marked as outdated
- [ ] Ensure philosophy-first approach is clear in all user-facing content

## üí´ **Success Celebration**

Upon completion, the documentation will reflect the sophisticated but simple vision you've been working toward: **a platform where Indigenous wisdom guides technical innovation to create transformational learning experiences**.

**From document chaos to philosophical clarity. From competing visions to unified direction. From technical complexity to simple pathways serving profound wisdom.**

This consolidation enables the team to focus entirely on building the remarkable platform described in the .kiro specifications, knowing that every document supports the same mission, vision, and approach.

---

*This consolidation plan serves the larger mission of creating a platform worthy of the transformational knowledge it contains. Every organizational decision, like every technical decision, serves the purpose of making Indigenous wisdom accessible to those ready to build more relational, sustainable, and just communities.*

**Documentation clarity enables implementation focus. Unified vision creates transformational outcomes.**
