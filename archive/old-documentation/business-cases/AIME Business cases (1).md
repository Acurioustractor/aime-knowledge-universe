# **Presidents: Young Leaders Reimagining Custodial Economies**

*A Comprehensive Business Case for Youth Development organisations and Environmental Foundations*

---

## **Executive Summary**

Presidents represents a transformative pathway for young people—particularly Indigenous youth and those from marginalised communities—to move from climate protest to constructive action by developing custodial economies that center nature in economic development. Rather than inheriting environmental disasters without agency, Presidents participants create practical case studies demonstrating how economic systems can enhance rather than degrade ecological health while generating sustainable livelihoods.

For youth development organisations and environmental foundations seeking authentic approaches to climate action that empower rather than marginalise young people, Presidents provides proven frameworks for developing leadership capacity while addressing urgent environmental challenges through innovative economic models that honor both human flourishing and ecological integrity.

The program operates through structured mentorship that connects young leaders with Indigenous knowledge holders and systems change practitioners while providing resources and platform access for developing and implementing custodial economy projects that demonstrate alternatives to extractive economic models.

**Target Audience:** Youth development program directors, environmental foundation program officers, climate justice organisations, and Indigenous community leaders seeking to empower young people as solution creators rather than problem inheritors.

## **The Challenge: Youth Climate Anxiety Without Agency**

*\[Visual Reference: Youth Climate Impact Chart showing escalating environmental challenges vs. declining youth agency and hope\]*

Young people today inherit unprecedented environmental challenges including climate instability, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem degradation that previous generations created but current institutions seem unable to address effectively. Traditional responses often position young people as future victims of environmental disasters rather than current leaders capable of creating solutions.

This dynamic creates what researchers term "climate anxiety" and "eco-grief" as young people recognise the severity of environmental challenges while feeling powerless to create meaningful change. Conventional environmental education emphasises problems without providing pathways for young people to contribute to solutions, creating knowledge without agency that often increases rather than decreases feelings of helplessness.

Climate activism often focuses on protest and resistance that, while important for raising awareness, does not provide young people with opportunities to develop practical skills for creating the alternative economic systems needed to address environmental challenges sustainably. Many young activists experience burnout from fighting against systems without having opportunities to build alternatives.

Educational and employment systems continue preparing young people for economic models that created environmental problems rather than developing their capacity for designing regenerative approaches. Young people graduate with degrees in unsustainable industries while missing opportunities to develop expertise in environmental restoration, regenerative agriculture, and other approaches needed for ecological healing.

*\[Visual Reference: Pathway Gap Analysis showing disconnect between environmental awareness and economic opportunity\]*

Indigenous youth face additional challenges as they inherit both environmental degradation and cultural disruption while often being excluded from environmental movements that ignore Indigenous knowledge and leadership. They possess cultural knowledge relevant to environmental solutions but lack economic pathways that honor rather than exploit traditional wisdom.

Young people from marginalised communities understand environmental injustice through lived experience but often lack resources and platform access needed to implement solutions they can envision. Their perspectives and innovations remain unrecognised while environmental solutions continue being developed by institutions that lack diversity and community connection.

The challenge becomes more urgent as climate impacts intensify while existing economic systems continue prioritizing short-term profits over long-term sustainability. Young people need opportunities to demonstrate that alternative economic models can create prosperity while healing rather than harming environmental systems.

## **Market Context & Custodial Economy Opportunity**

*\[Visual Reference: Economic Opportunity Landscape showing $800B nature repair market vs. $125T nature-centered economy vs. current youth economic exclusion\]*

The nature repair market, estimated at $800 billion globally, represents enormous opportunities for economic development that improves rather than degrades environmental conditions. However, most young people lack access to this market because educational and training systems continue preparing them for extractive industries rather than regenerative approaches.

The broader nature-centered economy, valued at $125 trillion, demonstrates the scale of economic activity that could operate through ecological principles rather than against them. Young people possess the creativity and motivation needed to innovate within this space but require mentorship, resources, and platform access to develop their capabilities effectively.

Environmental restoration, regenerative agriculture, renewable energy, and ecosystem services represent rapidly growing economic sectors that offer alternatives to industries that created environmental problems. Young people entering these fields now can become leaders as these sectors expand while contributing to solutions for challenges they will inherit.

*\[Visual Reference: Youth Innovation Potential Matrix showing young people's unique advantages for environmental innovation\]*

### **Competitive Advantages of Youth Environmental Leadership**

Young people possess several unique advantages for environmental innovation that create distinctive value propositions for Presidents program participation. They have direct stakes in long-term environmental outcomes that older generations may not experience, creating motivation for sustainable solutions rather than short-term fixes.

Digital nativity enables young people to leverage technology for environmental solutions while building networks that transcend geographic and institutional boundaries. They understand collaborative approaches to problem-solving that environmental challenges require rather than competitive models that often perpetuate rather than solve problems.

Cultural diversity among young environmental leaders brings perspectives and knowledge systems that conventional environmental approaches often overlook. Indigenous youth, in particular, possess traditional knowledge relevant to contemporary environmental challenges while understanding modern implementation contexts.

Young people often think systemically about environmental challenges rather than treating them as isolated technical problems, enabling approaches that address root causes rather than symptoms. They understand connections between environmental degradation and social justice that older environmental movements sometimes miss.

The network integrated traditional Indigenous agricultural knowledge with contemporary sustainable farming techniques to create approaches that enhance soil health, increase biodiversity, and improve water retention while generating economic returns that support community development and cultural preservation.

"Our ancestors understood how to work with the land rather than against it," said Maria Strongbear, network coordinator and 2027 Presidents graduate. "Presidents helped us translate traditional knowledge into contemporary economic models that demonstrate how environmental stewardship can create prosperity for our communities."

The success has attracted attention from international development organisations as governments worldwide seek proven approaches to agricultural sustainability and rural economic development. Several countries have initiated discussions about adapting network methodologies for their own agricultural challenges and rural community development needs.

Economic analysis indicates that regenerative agriculture approaches developed by the network achieve higher long-term profitability than conventional farming while creating positive environmental impacts that generate additional community benefits. Agricultural colleges are now integrating network methodologies into their curriculum as examples of sustainable farming innovation.

The network's success demonstrates how young Indigenous leaders can contribute to both environmental restoration and economic development while strengthening rather than compromising cultural traditions and community connections.

### **2034: Urban Youth Collective Transforms City Environmental Policy**

**Detroit, Michigan \- April 22, 2034** \- The Detroit Youth Environmental Justice Collective announced that their five-year custodial economy development initiative has influenced city environmental policy adoption that prioritises community-led environmental restoration while creating over 800 green jobs for local residents.

The collective, composed primarily of Presidents program graduates from marginalised Detroit communities, developed urban agriculture, renewable energy, and environmental restoration projects that demonstrated how environmental solutions could address both ecological challenges and economic inequality simultaneously.

"Environmental justice means communities most affected by environmental problems lead the solutions," said James Washington, collective founding member and 2030 Presidents graduate. "Our projects proved that young people from impacted communities possess the creativity and knowledge needed to create effective environmental solutions."

City government adoption of collective policy recommendations represents unprecedented recognition of youth environmental leadership while creating systemic changes that benefit entire metropolitan area. The policy framework has influenced environmental justice discussions nationwide as other cities consider similar community-led approaches.
